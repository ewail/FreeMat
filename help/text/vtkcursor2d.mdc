 Usage

vtkCursor2D is a class that generates a 2D cursor
representation. The cursor consists of two intersection axes
lines that meet at the cursor focus. Several optional
features are available as well. An optional 2D bounding box
may be enabled. An inner radius, centered at the focal
point, can be set that erases the intersecting lines (e.g.,
it leaves a clear area under the focal point so you can see
what you are selecting). And finally, an optional point can
be enabled located at the focal point. All of these features
can be turned on and off independently.
To create an instance of class vtkCursor2D, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkCursor2D



 Methods

The class vtkCursor2D has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkCursor2D class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkCursor2D = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkCursor2D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetModelBounds (double xmin, double xmax, double ymin,
  double ymax, double zmin, double zmax) - Set / get the
  bounding box of the 2D cursor. This defines the outline of
  the cursor, and where the focal point should lie.
* obj.SetModelBounds (double bounds[6]) - Set / get the
  bounding box of the 2D cursor. This defines the outline of
  the cursor, and where the focal point should lie.
* double = obj. GetModelBounds () - Set / get the bounding
  box of the 2D cursor. This defines the outline of the
  cursor, and where the focal point should lie.
* obj.SetFocalPoint (double x[3]) - Set/Get the position of
  cursor focus. If translation mode is on, then the entire
  cursor (including bounding box, cursor, and shadows) is
  translated. Otherwise, the focal point will either be
  clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if Wrap is on.
  (Note: this behavior requires that the bounding box is set
  prior to the focal point.) Note that the method takes a 3D
  point but ignores the z-coordinate value.
* obj.SetFocalPoint (double x, double y, double z) - Set/Get
  the position of cursor focus. If translation mode is on,
  then the entire cursor (including bounding box, cursor,
  and shadows) is translated. Otherwise, the focal point
  will either be clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if
  Wrap is on. (Note: this behavior requires that the
  bounding box is set prior to the focal point.) Note that
  the method takes a 3D point but ignores the z-coordinate
  value.
* double = obj. GetFocalPoint () - Set/Get the position of
  cursor focus. If translation mode is on, then the entire
  cursor (including bounding box, cursor, and shadows) is
  translated. Otherwise, the focal point will either be
  clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if Wrap is on.
  (Note: this behavior requires that the bounding box is set
  prior to the focal point.) Note that the method takes a 3D
  point but ignores the z-coordinate value.
* obj.SetOutline (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding
  box.
* int = obj.GetOutline () - Turn on/off the wireframe
  bounding box.
* obj.OutlineOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding box.
* obj.OutlineOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding
  box.
* obj.SetAxes (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* int = obj.GetAxes () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.AxesOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.AxesOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.SetRadius (double ) - Specify a radius for a circle.
  This erases the cursor lines around the focal point.
* double = obj.GetRadiusMinValue () - Specify a radius for a
  circle. This erases the cursor lines around the focal
  point.
* double = obj.GetRadiusMaxValue () - Specify a radius for a
  circle. This erases the cursor lines around the focal
  point.
* double = obj.GetRadius () - Specify a radius for a circle.
  This erases the cursor lines around the focal point.
* obj.SetPoint (int ) - Turn on/off the point located at the
  cursor focus.
* int = obj.GetPoint () - Turn on/off the point located at
  the cursor focus.
* obj.PointOn () - Turn on/off the point located at the
  cursor focus.
* obj.PointOff () - Turn on/off the point located at the
  cursor focus.
* obj.SetTranslationMode (int ) - Enable/disable the
  translation mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause
  the entire widget to translate along with the cursor. By
  default, translation mode is off.
* int = obj.GetTranslationMode () - Enable/disable the
  translation mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause
  the entire widget to translate along with the cursor. By
  default, translation mode is off.
* obj.TranslationModeOn () - Enable/disable the translation
  mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause the entire
  widget to translate along with the cursor. By default,
  translation mode is off.
* obj.TranslationModeOff () - Enable/disable the translation
  mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause the entire
  widget to translate along with the cursor. By default,
  translation mode is off.
* obj.SetWrap (int ) - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* int = obj.GetWrap () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* obj.WrapOn () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the cursor
  focus moves outside the specified bounds, the cursor will
  either be restrained against the nearest "wall"
  (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* obj.WrapOff () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* obj.AllOn () - Turn every part of the cursor on or off.
* obj.AllOff () - Turn every part of the cursor on or off.
