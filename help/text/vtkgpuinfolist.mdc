 Usage

vtkGPUInfoList stores a list of vtkGPUInfo. An host can have
several GPUs. It creates and sets the list by probing the
host with system calls. This an abstract class. Concrete
classes are OS specific.
To create an instance of class vtkGPUInfoList, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkGPUInfoList



 Methods

The class vtkGPUInfoList has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkGPUInfoList class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkGPUInfoList = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkGPUInfoList = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.Probe () - Build the list of vtkInfoGPU if not done
  yet. Default implementation created an empty list. Useful
  if there is no implementation available for a given
  architecture yet.


    Postcondition:
        probed: IsProbed()

* bool = obj.IsProbed () - Tells if the operating system has
  been probed. Initial value is false.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfGPUs () - Return the number of GPUs.


    Precondition:
        probed: IsProbed()

* vtkGPUInfo = obj.GetGPUInfo (int i) - Return information
  about GPU i.


    Precondition:
        probed: IsProbed()
        valid_index: i>=0 &amp;&amp; i<GetNumberOfGPUs()



    Postcondition:
        result_exists: result!=0
