 Usage

Computes the integer division of two arrays. The syntax for
its use is

     y = idiv(a,b)

where a and b are arrays or scalars. The effect of the idiv
is to compute the integer division of b into a.


 Example

The following examples show some uses of idiv arrays.

  --> idiv(27,6)

  ans =
   4

  --> idiv(4,-2)

  ans =
   -2

  --> idiv(15,3)

  ans =
   5
