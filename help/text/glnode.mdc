 Usage

Define a GL Node. A GL Node is an object that can be
displayed in a GL Window. It is defined by a triangular mesh
of vertices. It must also have a material that defines its
appearance (i.e. color, shininess, etc.). The syntax for the
glnode command is

    glnode(name,material,pointset)

where material is the name of a material that has already
been defined with gldefmaterial, pointset is a 3 x N matrix
of points that define the geometry of the object. Note that
the points are assumed to be connected in triangular facts,
with the points defined counter clock-wise as seen from the
outside of the facet. FreeMat will compute the normals. The
name argument must be unique. If you want multiple instances
of a given glnode in your GLWindow, that is fine, as
instances of a glnode are created through a glassembly.
