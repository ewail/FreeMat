 Usage

Toggles the hold state on the currently active plot. The
general syntax for its use is

     hold(state)

where state is either

     hold('on')

to turn hold on, or

     hold('off')

to turn hold off. If you specify no argument then hold
toggles the state of the hold:

     hold

You can also specify a particular axis to the hold command

     hold(handle,...)

where handle is the handle for a particular axis.


 Internals

The hold function allows one to construct a plot sequence
incrementally, instead of issuing all of the plots
simultaneously using the plot command.


 Example

Here is an example of using both the hold command and the
multiple-argument plot command to construct a plot composed
of three sets of data. The first is a plot of a modulated
Gaussian.

  --> x = linspace(-5,5,500);
  --> t = exp(-x.^2);
  --> y = t.*cos(2*pi*x*3);
  --> plot(x,y);

We now turn the hold state to 'on', and add another plot
sequence, this time composed of the top and bottom envelopes
of the modulated Gaussian. We add the two envelopes
simultaneously using a single plot command. The fact that
hold is 'on' means that these two envelopes are added to
(instead of replace) the current contents of the plot.

  --> plot(x,y);
  --> hold on
  --> plot(x,t,'g-',x,-t,'b-')
