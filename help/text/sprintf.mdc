 Usage

Prints values to a string. The general syntax for its use is

    y = sprintf(format,a1,a2,...).

Here format is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the output. The values of the
variables a_i are substituted into the output as required.
It is an error if there are not enough variables to satisfy
the format string. Note that this sprintf command is not
vectorized! Each variable must be a scalar. The returned
value y contains the string that would normally have been
printed. For more details on the format string, see printf.


 Examples

Here is an example of a loop that generates a sequence of
files based on a template name, and stores them in a cell
array.

  --> l = {}; for i = 1:5; s = sprintf('file_%d.dat',i); l
  (i) = {s}; end;
  --> l

  ans =
   [file_1.dat] [file_2.dat] [file_3.dat] [file_4.dat]
  [file_5.dat]
