 Usage

vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter is an interpolating
subdivision scheme that creates four new triangles for each
triangle in the mesh. The user can specify the
NumberOfSubdivisions. This filter implements the 8-point
butterfly scheme described in: Zorin, D., Schroder, P., and
Sweldens, W., "Interpolating Subdivisions for Meshes with
Arbitrary Topology," Computer Graphics Proceedings, Annual
Conference Series, 1996, ACM SIGGRAPH, pp.189-192. This
scheme improves previous butterfly subdivisions with special
treatment of vertices with valence other than 6.
Currently, the filter only operates on triangles. Users
should use the vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate meshes that
contain polygons or triangle strips.
The filter interpolates point data using the same scheme.
New triangles created at a subdivision step will have the
cell data of their parent cell.
To create an instance of class
vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter, simply invoke its constructor
as follows

    obj = vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter



 Methods

The class vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter has several methods
that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Construct object with
  NumberOfSubdivisions set to 1.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Construct object with
  NumberOfSubdivisions set to 1.
* vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter = obj.NewInstance () -
  Construct object with NumberOfSubdivisions set to 1.
* vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o) - Construct object with NumberOfSubdivisions
  set to 1.
