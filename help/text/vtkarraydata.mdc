 Usage

Because vtkArray cannot be stored as attributes of data
objects (yet), a "carrier" object is needed to pass vtkArray
through the pipeline. vtkArrayData acts as a container of
zero-to-many vtkArray instances, which can be retrieved via
a zero-based index. Note that a collection of arrays stored
in vtkArrayData may-or-may-not have related types,
dimensions, or extents.
To create an instance of class vtkArrayData, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkArrayData



 Methods

The class vtkArrayData has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkArrayData class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkArrayData = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkArrayData = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.AddArray (vtkArray ) - Adds a vtkArray to the
  collection
* obj.ClearArrays () - Clears the contents of the collection
* vtkIdType = obj.GetNumberOfArrays () - Returns the number
  of vtkArray instances in the collection
* vtkArray = obj.GetArray (vtkIdType index) - Returns the n-
  th vtkArray in the collection
* vtkArray = obj.GetArrayByName (string name) - Returns the
  array having called name from the collection
* int = obj.GetDataObjectType ()
* obj.ShallowCopy (vtkDataObject other)
* obj.DeepCopy (vtkDataObject other)
