 Usage

This class provides scalable broadcast, reduce, etc. using
only a vtkMultiProcessController. It does not require MPI.
Users are vtkPKdTree and vtkDistributedDataFilter.
.SECTION Note This class will be deprecated soon. Instead of
using this class, use the collective and subgrouping
operations now built into vtkMultiProcessController. The
only reason this class is not deprecated already is because
vtkPKdTree relies heavily on this class in ways that are not
easy to work around. Since vtkPKdTree is due for a major
overhaul anyway, we are leaving things the way they are for
now.
To create an instance of class vtkSubGroup, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSubGroup



 Methods

The class vtkSubGroup has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkSubGroup class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSubGroup = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSubGroup = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* int = obj.Initialize (int p0, int p1, int me, int tag,
  vtkCommunicator c)
* int = obj.Gather (int data, int to, int length, int root)
* int = obj.Gather (string data, string to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.Gather (float data, float to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.Broadcast (float data, int length, int root)
* int = obj.Broadcast (double data, int length, int root)
* int = obj.Broadcast (int data, int length, int root)
* int = obj.Broadcast (string data, int length, int root)
* int = obj.ReduceSum (int data, int to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.ReduceMax (float data, float to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.ReduceMax (double data, double to, int length,
  int root)
* int = obj.ReduceMax (int data, int to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.ReduceMin (float data, float to, int length, int
  root)
* int = obj.ReduceMin (double data, double to, int length,
  int root)
* int = obj.ReduceMin (int data, int to, int length, int
  root)
* obj.setGatherPattern (int root, int length)
* int = obj.getLocalRank (int processID)
* int = obj.Barrier ()
* obj.PrintSubGroup () const
