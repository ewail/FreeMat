 Usage

MINC is a NetCDF-based medical image file format that was
developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute in 1992.
The data is written slice-by-slice, and this writer is
therefore suitable for streaming MINC data that is larger
than the memory size through VTK. This writer can also
produce files with up to 4 dimensions, where the fourth
dimension is provided by using AddInput() to specify
multiple input data sets. If you want to set header
information for the file, you must supply a
vtkMINCImageAttributes
To create an instance of class vtkMINCImageWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkMINCImageWriter



 Methods

The class vtkMINCImageWriter has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkMINCImageWriter class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkMINCImageWriter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkMINCImageWriter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* string = obj.GetFileExtensions () - Get the name of this
  file format.
* string = obj.GetDescriptiveName () - Set the file name.
* obj.SetFileName (string name) - Set the file name.
* obj.Write () - Write the data. This will attempt to stream
  the data slice-by-slice through the pipeline and out to
  the file, unless the whole extent of the input has already
  been updated.
* obj.SetDirectionCosines (vtkMatrix4x4 matrix) - Set a
  matrix that describes the orientation of the data. The
  three columns of this matrix should give the unit-vector
  directions for the VTK x, y and z dimensions respectively.
  The writer will use this information to determine how to
  map the VTK dimensions to the canonical MINC dimensions,
  and if necessary, the writer will re-order one or more
  dimensions back-to-front to ensure that no MINC dimension
  ends up with a direction cosines vector whose dot product
  with the canonical unit vector for that dimension is
  negative.
* vtkMatrix4x4 = obj.GetDirectionCosines () - Set a matrix
  that describes the orientation of the data. The three
  columns of this matrix should give the unit-vector
  directions for the VTK x, y and z dimensions respectively.
  The writer will use this information to determine how to
  map the VTK dimensions to the canonical MINC dimensions,
  and if necessary, the writer will re-order one or more
  dimensions back-to-front to ensure that no MINC dimension
  ends up with a direction cosines vector whose dot product
  with the canonical unit vector for that dimension is
  negative.
* obj.SetRescaleSlope (double ) - Set the slope and
  intercept for rescaling the intensities. The default
  values are zero, which indicates to the reader that no
  rescaling is to be performed.
* double = obj.GetRescaleSlope () - Set the slope and
  intercept for rescaling the intensities. The default
  values are zero, which indicates to the reader that no
  rescaling is to be performed.
* obj.SetRescaleIntercept (double ) - Set the slope and
  intercept for rescaling the intensities. The default
  values are zero, which indicates to the reader that no
  rescaling is to be performed.
* double = obj.GetRescaleIntercept () - Set the slope and
  intercept for rescaling the intensities. The default
  values are zero, which indicates to the reader that no
  rescaling is to be performed.
* obj.SetImageAttributes (vtkMINCImageAttributes attributes)
  - Set the image attributes, which contain patient
  information and other useful metadata.
* vtkMINCImageAttributes = obj.GetImageAttributes () - Set
  the image attributes, which contain patient information
  and other useful metadata.
* obj.SetStrictValidation (int ) - Set whether to validate
  that all variable attributes that have been set are ones
  that are listed in the MINC standard.
* obj.StrictValidationOn () - Set whether to validate that
  all variable attributes that have been set are ones that
  are listed in the MINC standard.
* obj.StrictValidationOff () - Set whether to validate that
  all variable attributes that have been set are ones that
  are listed in the MINC standard.
* int = obj.GetStrictValidation () - Set whether to validate
  that all variable attributes that have been set are ones
  that are listed in the MINC standard.
* obj.SetHistoryAddition (string ) - Set a string value to
  append to the history of the file. This string should
  describe, briefly, how the file was processed.
* string = obj.GetHistoryAddition () - Set a string value to
  append to the history of the file. This string should
  describe, briefly, how the file was processed.
