 Usage

The threadid function in FreeMat tells you which thread is
executing the context you are in. Normally, this is thread
1, the main thread. However, if you start a new thread using
threadnew, you will be operating in a new thread, and
functions that call threadid from the new thread will return
their handles.


 Example

From the main thread, we have

  --> threadid

  ans =
   2

But from a launched auxilliary thread, we have

  --> t_id = threadnew

  t_id =
   3

  --> id = threadcall(t_id,1000,'threadid')

  id =
   3

  --> threadfree(t_id);
