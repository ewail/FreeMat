 Usage

The threadnew function creates a new FreeMat thread, and
returns a handle to the resulting thread. The threadnew
function takes no arguments. They general syntax for the
threadnew function is

     handle = threadnew

Once you have a handle to a thread, you can start the thread
on a computation using the threadstart function. The threads
returned by threadnew are in a dormant state (i.e., not
running). Once you are finished with the thread you must
call threadfree to free the resources associated with that
thread.
Some additional important information. Thread functions
operate in their own context or workspace, which means that
data cannot be shared between threads. The exception is
global variables, which provide a thread-safe way for
multiple threads to share data. Accesses to global variables
are serialized so that they can be used to share data.
Threads and FreeMat are a new feature, so there is room for
improvement in the API and behavior. The best way to improve
threads is to experiment with them, and send feedback.
