 Methods

The class vtkInformationIntegerKey has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkInformationIntegerKey class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkInformationIntegerKey = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkInformationIntegerKey = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* vtkInformationIntegerKey = obj.(string name, string
  location)
* ~vtkInformationIntegerKey = obj.()
* obj.Set (vtkInformation info, int ) - Get/Set the value
  associated with this key in the given information object.
* int = obj.Get (vtkInformation info) - Get/Set the value
  associated with this key in the given information object.
* obj.ShallowCopy (vtkInformation from, vtkInformation to) -
  Copy the entry associated with this key from one
  information object to another. If there is no entry in the
  first information object for this key, the value is
  removed from the second.
