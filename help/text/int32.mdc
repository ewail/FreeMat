 Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 32-bit Integer. The
syntax for its use is

     y = int32(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array. Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the
normal range for a signed 32-bit integer of [-
2147483647,2147483647], it is truncated to that range). Note
that both NaN and Inf both map to 0.


 Example

The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of
int32. First, the routine uses

  --> int32(100)

  ans =
   100

  --> int32(-100)

  ans =
   -100

In the next example, an integer outside the range of the
type is passed in. The result is truncated to the range of
the data type.

  --> int32(40e9)

  ans =
   2147483647

In the next example, a positive double precision argument is
passed in. The result is the signed integer that is closest
to the argument.

  --> int32(pi)

  ans =
   3

In the next example, a complex argument is passed in. The
result is the signed complex integer that is closest to the
argument.

  --> int32(5+2*i)

  ans =
     5.0000 +  2.0000i

In the next example, a string argument is passed in. The
string argument is converted into an integer array
corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.

  --> int32('helo')

  ans =
   104 101 108 111

In the last example, a cell-array is passed in. For cell-
arrays and structure arrays, the result is an error.

  --> int32({4})
  Error: Cannot perform type conversions with this type
