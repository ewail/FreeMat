 Usage

Tests for two arrays to be identical. The syntax for its use
is

     y = issame(a,b)

where a and b are two arrays to compare. This comparison
succeeds only if a and b are of the same data type, size,
and contents. Unlike numerical equivalence tests, the issame
function considers NaN to be equal in both arguments.
