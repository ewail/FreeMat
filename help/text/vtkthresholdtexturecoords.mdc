 Usage

vtkThresholdTextureCoords is a filter that generates texture
coordinates for any input dataset type given a threshold
criterion. The criterion can take three forms: 1) greater
than a particular value (ThresholdByUpper()); 2) less than a
particular value (ThresholdByLower(); or 3) between two
values (ThresholdBetween(). If the threshold criterion is
satisfied, the "in" texture coordinate will be set (this can
be specified by the user). If the threshold criterion is not
satisfied the "out" is set.
To create an instance of class vtkThresholdTextureCoords,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkThresholdTextureCoords



 Methods

The class vtkThresholdTextureCoords has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkThresholdTextureCoords class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkThresholdTextureCoords = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkThresholdTextureCoords = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.ThresholdByLower (double lower) - Criterion is cells
  whose scalars are less than lower threshold.
* obj.ThresholdByUpper (double upper) - Criterion is cells
  whose scalars are less than upper threshold.
* obj.ThresholdBetween (double lower, double upper) -
  Criterion is cells whose scalars are between lower and
  upper thresholds.
* double = obj.GetUpperThreshold () - Return the upper and
  lower thresholds.
* double = obj.GetLowerThreshold () - Return the upper and
  lower thresholds.
* obj.SetTextureDimension (int ) - Set the desired dimension
  of the texture map.
* int = obj.GetTextureDimensionMinValue () - Set the desired
  dimension of the texture map.
* int = obj.GetTextureDimensionMaxValue () - Set the desired
  dimension of the texture map.
* int = obj.GetTextureDimension () - Set the desired
  dimension of the texture map.
* obj.SetInTextureCoord (double , double , double ) - Set
  the texture coordinate value for point satisfying
  threshold criterion.
* obj.SetInTextureCoord (double a[3]) - Set the texture
  coordinate value for point satisfying threshold criterion.
* double = obj. GetInTextureCoord () - Set the texture
  coordinate value for point satisfying threshold criterion.
* obj.SetOutTextureCoord (double , double , double ) - Set
  the texture coordinate value for point NOT satisfying
  threshold criterion.
* obj.SetOutTextureCoord (double a[3]) - Set the texture
  coordinate value for point NOT satisfying threshold
  criterion.
* double = obj. GetOutTextureCoord () - Set the texture
  coordinate value for point NOT satisfying threshold
  criterion.
