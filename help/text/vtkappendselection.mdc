 Usage

vtkAppendSelection is a filter that appends one of more
selections into a single selection. All selections must have
the same content type unless AppendByUnion is false.
To create an instance of class vtkAppendSelection, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkAppendSelection



 Methods

The class vtkAppendSelection has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkAppendSelection class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkAppendSelection = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkAppendSelection = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetUserManagedInputs (int ) - UserManagedInputs allows
  the user to set inputs by number instead of using the
  AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
  SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed
  with calls to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default,
  UserManagedInputs is false.
* int = obj.GetUserManagedInputs () - UserManagedInputs
  allows the user to set inputs by number instead of using
  the AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
  SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed
  with calls to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default,
  UserManagedInputs is false.
* obj.UserManagedInputsOn () - UserManagedInputs allows the
  user to set inputs by number instead of using the
  AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
  SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed
  with calls to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default,
  UserManagedInputs is false.
* obj.UserManagedInputsOff () - UserManagedInputs allows the
  user to set inputs by number instead of using the
  AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
  SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed
  with calls to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default,
  UserManagedInputs is false.
* obj.AddInput (vtkSelection ) - Add a dataset to the list
  of data to append. Should not be used when
  UserManagedInputs is true, use SetInputByNumber instead.
* obj.RemoveInput (vtkSelection ) - Remove a dataset from
  the list of data to append. Should not be used when
  UserManagedInputs is true, use SetInputByNumber (NULL)
  instead.
* obj.SetNumberOfInputs (int num) - Directly set(allocate)
  number of inputs, should only be used when
  UserManagedInputs is true.
* obj.SetInputByNumber (int num, vtkSelection input)
* obj.SetAppendByUnion (int ) - When set to true, all the
  selections are combined together to form a single
  vtkSelection output. When set to false, the output is a
  composite selection with input selections as the children
  of the composite selection. This allows for selections
  with different content types and properties. Default is
  true.
* int = obj.GetAppendByUnion () - When set to true, all the
  selections are combined together to form a single
  vtkSelection output. When set to false, the output is a
  composite selection with input selections as the children
  of the composite selection. This allows for selections
  with different content types and properties. Default is
  true.
* obj.AppendByUnionOn () - When set to true, all the
  selections are combined together to form a single
  vtkSelection output. When set to false, the output is a
  composite selection with input selections as the children
  of the composite selection. This allows for selections
  with different content types and properties. Default is
  true.
* obj.AppendByUnionOff () - When set to true, all the
  selections are combined together to form a single
  vtkSelection output. When set to false, the output is a
  composite selection with input selections as the children
  of the composite selection. This allows for selections
  with different content types and properties. Default is
  true.
