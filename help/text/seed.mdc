 Usage

Seeds the random number generator using the given integer
seeds. Changing the seed allows you to choose which pseudo-
random sequence is generated. The seed takes two uint32
values:

    seed(s,t)

where s and t are the seed values. Note that due to
limitations in ranlib, the values of s,t must be between 0
<= s,t <= 2^30.


 Example

Here's an example of how the seed value can be used to
reproduce a specific random number sequence.

  --> seed(32,41);
  --> rand(1,5)

  ans =
      0.8589    0.3727    0.5551    0.9557    0.7367

  --> seed(32,41);
  --> rand(1,5)

  ans =
      0.8589    0.3727    0.5551    0.9557    0.7367
