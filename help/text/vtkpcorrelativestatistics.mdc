 Usage

vtkPCorrelativeStatistics is vtkCorrelativeStatistics
subclass for parallel datasets. It learns and derives the
global statistical model on each node, but assesses each
individual data points on the node that owns it.
To create an instance of class vtkPCorrelativeStatistics,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkPCorrelativeStatistics



 Methods

The class vtkPCorrelativeStatistics has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkPCorrelativeStatistics class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkPCorrelativeStatistics = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkPCorrelativeStatistics = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController ) - Get/Set
  the multiprocess controller. If no controller is set,
  single process is assumed.
* vtkMultiProcessController = obj.GetController () - Get/Set
  the multiprocess controller. If no controller is set,
  single process is assumed.
* obj.Learn (vtkTable inData, vtkTable inParameters,
  vtkDataObject outMeta) - Execute the parallel calculations
  required by the Learn option.
