 Usage

vtkGeoTerrain contains a multi-resolution tree of geometry
representing the globe. It uses a vtkGeoSource subclass to
generate the terrain, such as vtkGeoGlobeSource. This source
must be set before using the terrain in a vtkGeoView. The
terrain also contains an AddActors() method which will
update the set of actors representing the globe given the
current camera position.
To create an instance of class vtkGeoTerrain, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkGeoTerrain



 Methods

The class vtkGeoTerrain has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkGeoTerrain class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkGeoTerrain = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkGeoTerrain = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* vtkGeoSource = obj.GetSource () - The source used to
  obtain geometry patches.
* obj.SetSource (vtkGeoSource source) - The source used to
  obtain geometry patches.
* obj.SaveDatabase (string path, int depth) - Save the set
  of patches up to a given maximum depth.
* obj.AddActors (vtkRenderer ren, vtkAssembly assembly,
  vtkCollection imageReps) - Update the actors in an
  assembly used to render the globe. ren is the current
  renderer, and imageReps holds the collection of
  vtkGeoAlignedImageRepresentations that will be blended
  together to form the image on the globe.
* obj.SetOrigin (double , double , double ) - The world-
  coordinate origin offset used to eliminate precision
  errors when zoomed in to a particular region of the globe.
* obj.SetOrigin (double a[3]) - The world-coordinate origin
  offset used to eliminate precision errors when zoomed in
  to a particular region of the globe.
* double = obj. GetOrigin () - The world-coordinate origin
  offset used to eliminate precision errors when zoomed in
  to a particular region of the globe.
* obj.SetMaxLevel (int ) - The maximum level of the terrain
  tree.
* int = obj.GetMaxLevelMinValue () - The maximum level of
  the terrain tree.
* int = obj.GetMaxLevelMaxValue () - The maximum level of
  the terrain tree.
* int = obj.GetMaxLevel () - The maximum level of the
  terrain tree.
