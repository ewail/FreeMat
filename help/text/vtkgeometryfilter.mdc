 Usage

vtkGeometryFilter is a general-purpose filter to extract
geometry (and associated data) from any type of dataset.
Geometry is obtained as follows: all 0D, 1D, and 2D cells
are extracted. All 2D faces that are used by only one 3D
cell (i.e., boundary faces) are extracted. It also is
possible to specify conditions on point ids, cell ids, and
on bounding box (referred to as "Extent") to control the
extraction process.
This filter also may be used to convert any type of data to
polygonal type. The conversion process may be less than
satisfactory for some 3D datasets. For example, this filter
will extract the outer surface of a volume or structured
grid dataset. (For structured data you may want to use
vtkImageDataGeometryFilter, vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter,
vtkExtractUnstructuredGrid,
vtkRectilinearGridGeometryFilter, or vtkExtractVOI.)
To create an instance of class vtkGeometryFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkGeometryFilter



 Methods

The class vtkGeometryFilter has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkGeometryFilter class.

* obj.SetPointMinimum (vtkIdType ) - Specify the minimum
  point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMinimumMinValue () - Specify the
  minimum point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMinimumMaxValue () - Specify the
  minimum point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMinimum () - Specify the minimum
  point id for point id selection.
* obj.SetPointMaximum (vtkIdType ) - Specify the maximum
  point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMaximumMinValue () - Specify the
  maximum point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMaximumMaxValue () - Specify the
  maximum point id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointMaximum () - Specify the maximum
  point id for point id selection.
* obj.SetCellMinimum (vtkIdType ) - Specify the minimum cell
  id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMinimumMinValue () - Specify the
  minimum cell id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMinimumMaxValue () - Specify the
  minimum cell id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMinimum () - Specify the minimum
  cell id for point id selection.
* obj.SetCellMaximum (vtkIdType ) - Specify the maximum cell
  id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMaximumMinValue () - Specify the
  maximum cell id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMaximumMaxValue () - Specify the
  maximum cell id for point id selection.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetCellMaximum () - Specify the maximum
  cell id for point id selection.
* obj.SetExtent (double xMin, double xMax, double yMin,
  double yMax, double zMin, double zMax) - Specify a
  (xmin,xmax, ymin,ymax, zmin,zmax) bounding box to clip
  data.
* obj.SetExtent (double extent[6]) - Set / get a (xmin,xmax,
  ymin,ymax, zmin,zmax) bounding box to clip data.
* double = obj.GetExtent () - Set / get a (xmin,xmax,
  ymin,ymax, zmin,zmax) bounding box to clip data.
* obj.SetMerging (int ) - Turn on/off merging of coincident
  points. Note that is merging is on, points with different
  point attributes (e.g., normals) are merged, which may
  cause rendering artifacts.
* int = obj.GetMerging () - Turn on/off merging of
  coincident points. Note that is merging is on, points with
  different point attributes (e.g., normals) are merged,
  which may cause rendering artifacts.
* obj.MergingOn () - Turn on/off merging of coincident
  points. Note that is merging is on, points with different
  point attributes (e.g., normals) are merged, which may
  cause rendering artifacts.
* obj.MergingOff () - Turn on/off merging of coincident
  points. Note that is merging is on, points with different
  point attributes (e.g., normals) are merged, which may
  cause rendering artifacts.
* obj.SetLocator (vtkIncrementalPointLocator locator) - Set
  / get a spatial locator for merging points. By default an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
* vtkIncrementalPointLocator = obj.GetLocator () - Set / get
  a spatial locator for merging points. By default an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
* obj.CreateDefaultLocator () - Create default locator. Used
  to create one when none is specified.
* long = obj.GetMTime () - Return the MTime also considering
  the locator.
