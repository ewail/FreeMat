 Usage

Extends the vtkSLACReader to read in partitioned pieces. Due
to the nature of the data layout, this reader only works in
a data parallel mode where each process in a parallel job
simultaneously attempts to read the piece corresponding to
the local process id.
To create an instance of class vtkPSLACReader, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkPSLACReader



 Methods

The class vtkPSLACReader has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkPSLACReader class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkPSLACReader = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkPSLACReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* vtkMultiProcessController = obj.GetController () - The
  controller used to communicate partition data. The number
  of pieces requested must agree with the number of
  processes, the piece requested must agree with the local
  process id, and all process must invoke ProcessRequests of
  this filter simultaneously.
* obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController ) - The
  controller used to communicate partition data. The number
  of pieces requested must agree with the number of
  processes, the piece requested must agree with the local
  process id, and all process must invoke ProcessRequests of
  this filter simultaneously.
