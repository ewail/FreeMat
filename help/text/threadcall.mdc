 Usage

The threadcall function is a convenience function for
executing a function call in a thread. The syntax for its
use is

     [val1,...,valn] = threadcall
  (threadid,timeout,funcname,arg1,arg2,...)

where threadid is the ID of the thread (as returned by the
threadnew function), funcname is the name of the function to
call, and argi are the arguments to the function, and
timeout is the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the
function is allowed to take.


 Example

Here is an example of executing a simple function in a
different thread.

  --> id = threadnew

  id =
   3

  --> d = threadcall(id,1000,'cos',1.02343)

  d =
      0.5204

  --> threadfree(id)
