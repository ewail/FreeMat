 Usage

Generates a vector of non-central F-distributed random
variables with the specified parameters. The general syntax
for its use is

     y = randnf(n,m,c)

where n is the number of degrees of freedom in the
numerator, and m is the number of degrees of freedom in the
denominator. The vector c determines the non-centrality
shift of the numerator.


 Internals

A non-central F-distributed random variable is the ratio of
a non-central chi-square random variable and a central chi-
square random variable, i.e.,
 \[ F_{n,m,c} = \frac{\chi_{n,c}^2/n}{\chi_m^2/m}. \]


 Example

Here we use the randf to generate some non-central F-
distributed random variables:

  --> randnf(5*ones(1,9),7,1.34)

  ans =

   Columns 1 to 7

      0.5880    1.6093    0.4639    0.7857    2.5543
  0.5044    3.3383

   Columns 8 to 9

      1.4102    1.1489
