 Usage

The feval function executes a function using its name. The
syntax of feval is

    [y1,y2,...,yn] = feval(f,x1,x2,...,xm)

where f is the name of the function to evaluate, and xi are
the arguments to the function, and yi are the return values.
Alternately, f can be a function handle to a function (see
the section on function handles for more information).
Finally, FreeMat also supports f being a user defined class
in which case it will atttempt to invoke the subsref method
of the class.


 Example

Here is an example of using feval to call the cos function
indirectly.

  --> feval('cos',pi/4)

  ans =
      0.7071

Now, we call it through a function handle

  --> c = @cos

  c =
   @cos
  --> feval(c,pi/4)

  ans =
      0.7071

Here we construct an inline object (which is a user-defined
class) and use feval to call it

  --> afunc = inline('cos(t)+sin(t)','t')

  afunc =
    inline function object
    f(t) = cos(t)+sin(t)
  --> feval(afunc,pi)

  ans =
     -1.0000

  --> afunc(pi)

  ans =
     -1.0000

In both cases, (the feval call and the direct invokation),
FreeMat calls the subsref method of the class, which
computes the requested function.
