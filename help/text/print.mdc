 Usage

This function ``prints'' the currently active fig to a file.
The generic syntax for its use is

    print(filename)

or, alternately,

    print filename

where filename is the (string) filename of the destined
file. The current fig is then saved to the output file using
a format that is determined by the extension of the
filename. The exact output formats may vary on different
platforms, but generally speaking, the following extensions
should be supported cross-platform:

* jpg, jpeg &ndash; JPEG file
* pdf &ndash; Portable Document Format file
* png &ndash; Portable Net Graphics file
* svg &ndash; Scalable Vector Graphics file

Postscript (PS, EPS) is supported on non-Mac-OSX Unix only.
Note that only the fig is printed, not the window displaying
the fig. If you want something like that (essentially a
window-capture) use a seperate utility or your operating
system's built in screen capture ability.


 Example

Here is a simple example of how the figures in this manual
are generated.

  --> x = linspace(-1,1);
  --> y = cos(5*pi*x);
  --> plot(x,y,'r-');
  --> print('printfig1.jpg')
  --> print('printfig1.eps')

which creates three plots printfig.eps, which is an
Encapsulated PostScript file, printfig1.png, which is a
Portable Net Graphics file, and printfig1.jpg which is a
JPEG file.
