 Usage

vtkCursor3D is an object that generates a 3D representation
of a cursor. The cursor consists of a wireframe bounding
box, three intersecting axes lines that meet at the cursor
focus, and "shadows" or projections of the axes against the
sides of the bounding box. Each of these components can be
turned on/off.
This filter generates two output datasets. The first
(Output) is just the geometric representation of the cursor.
The second (Focus) is a single point at the focal point.
To create an instance of class vtkCursor3D, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkCursor3D



 Methods

The class vtkCursor3D has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkCursor3D class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkCursor3D = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkCursor3D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetModelBounds (double xmin, double xmax, double ymin,
  double ymax, double zmin, double zmax) - Set / get the
  boundary of the 3D cursor.
* obj.SetModelBounds (double bounds[6]) - Set / get the
  boundary of the 3D cursor.
* double = obj. GetModelBounds () - Set / get the boundary
  of the 3D cursor.
* obj.SetFocalPoint (double x[3]) - Set/Get the position of
  cursor focus. If translation mode is on, then the entire
  cursor (including bounding box, cursor, and shadows) is
  translated. Otherwise, the focal point will either be
  clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if Wrap is on.
  (Note: this behavior requires that the bounding box is set
  prior to the focal point.)
* obj.SetFocalPoint (double x, double y, double z) - Set/Get
  the position of cursor focus. If translation mode is on,
  then the entire cursor (including bounding box, cursor,
  and shadows) is translated. Otherwise, the focal point
  will either be clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if
  Wrap is on. (Note: this behavior requires that the
  bounding box is set prior to the focal point.)
* double = obj. GetFocalPoint () - Set/Get the position of
  cursor focus. If translation mode is on, then the entire
  cursor (including bounding box, cursor, and shadows) is
  translated. Otherwise, the focal point will either be
  clamped to the bounding box, or wrapped, if Wrap is on.
  (Note: this behavior requires that the bounding box is set
  prior to the focal point.)
* obj.SetOutline (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding
  box.
* int = obj.GetOutline () - Turn on/off the wireframe
  bounding box.
* obj.OutlineOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding box.
* obj.OutlineOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe bounding
  box.
* obj.SetAxes (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* int = obj.GetAxes () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.AxesOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.AxesOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe axes.
* obj.SetXShadows (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe x-
  shadows.
* int = obj.GetXShadows () - Turn on/off the wireframe x-
  shadows.
* obj.XShadowsOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe x-shadows.
* obj.XShadowsOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe x-shadows.
* obj.SetYShadows (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe y-
  shadows.
* int = obj.GetYShadows () - Turn on/off the wireframe y-
  shadows.
* obj.YShadowsOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe y-shadows.
* obj.YShadowsOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe y-shadows.
* obj.SetZShadows (int ) - Turn on/off the wireframe z-
  shadows.
* int = obj.GetZShadows () - Turn on/off the wireframe z-
  shadows.
* obj.ZShadowsOn () - Turn on/off the wireframe z-shadows.
* obj.ZShadowsOff () - Turn on/off the wireframe z-shadows.
* obj.SetTranslationMode (int ) - Enable/disable the
  translation mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause
  the entire widget to translate along with the cursor. By
  default, translation mode is off.
* int = obj.GetTranslationMode () - Enable/disable the
  translation mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause
  the entire widget to translate along with the cursor. By
  default, translation mode is off.
* obj.TranslationModeOn () - Enable/disable the translation
  mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause the entire
  widget to translate along with the cursor. By default,
  translation mode is off.
* obj.TranslationModeOff () - Enable/disable the translation
  mode. If on, changes in cursor position cause the entire
  widget to translate along with the cursor. By default,
  translation mode is off.
* obj.SetWrap (int ) - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* int = obj.GetWrap () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* obj.WrapOn () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the cursor
  focus moves outside the specified bounds, the cursor will
  either be restrained against the nearest "wall"
  (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* obj.WrapOff () - Turn on/off cursor wrapping. If the
  cursor focus moves outside the specified bounds, the
  cursor will either be restrained against the nearest
  "wall" (Wrap=off), or it will wrap around (Wrap=on).
* vtkPolyData = obj.GetFocus () - Get the focus for this
  filter.
* obj.AllOn () - Turn every part of the 3D cursor on or off.
* obj.AllOff () - Turn every part of the 3D cursor on or
  off.
