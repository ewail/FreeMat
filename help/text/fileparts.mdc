 Usage

The fileparts takes a filename, and returns the path,
filename, extension, and (for MATLAB-compatibility) an empty
version number of the file. The syntax for its use is

      [path,name,extension,version] = fileparts(filename)

where filename is a string containing the description of the
file, and path is the path to the file,
