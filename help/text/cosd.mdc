 Usage

Computes the cosine of the argument, but takes the argument
in degrees instead of radians (as is the case for cos). The
syntax for its use is

     y = cosd(x)



 Examples

The cosine of 45 degrees should be sqrt(2)/2

  --> cosd(45)

  ans =
      0.7071

and the cosine of 60 degrees should be 0.5:

  --> cosd(60)

  ans =
      0.5000
