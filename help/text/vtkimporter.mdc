 Usage

vtkImporter is an abstract class that specifies the protocol
for importing actors, cameras, lights and properties into a
vtkRenderWindow. The following takes place: 1) Create a
RenderWindow and Renderer if none is provided. 2) Call
ImportBegin, if ImportBegin returns False, return 3) Call
ReadData, which calls: a) Import the Actors b) Import the
cameras c) Import the lights d) Import the Properties 7)
Call ImportEnd
Subclasses optionally implement the ImportActors,
ImportCameras, ImportLights and ImportProperties or ReadData
methods. An ImportBegin and ImportEnd can optionally be
provided to perform Importer-specific initialization and
termination. The Read method initiates the import process.
If a RenderWindow is provided, its Renderer will contained
the imported objects. If the RenderWindow has no Renderer,
one is created. If no RenderWindow is provided, both a
RenderWindow and Renderer will be created. Both the
RenderWindow and Renderer can be accessed using Get methods.
To create an instance of class vtkImporter, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImporter



 Methods

The class vtkImporter has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkImporter class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImporter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImporter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* vtkRenderer = obj.GetRenderer ()
* obj.SetRenderWindow (vtkRenderWindow )
* vtkRenderWindow = obj.GetRenderWindow ()
* obj.Read ()
* obj.Update ()
