 Usage

This method is called for expressions of the form

    c = a(b), c = a{b}, c = a.b

and overloading the subsref method allows you to define the
meaning of these expressions for objects of class a. These
expressions are mapped to a call of the form

    b = subsref(a,s)

where s is a structure array with two fields. The first
field is

* type is a string containing either '()' or '{}' or '.'
  depending on the form of the call.
* subs is a cell array or string containing the the
  subscript information.

When multiple indexing experssions are combined together
such as b = a(5).foo{:}, the s array contains the following
entries

    s(1).type = '()'  s(1).subs = {5}
    s(2).type = '.'   s(2).subs = 'foo'
    s(3).type = '{}'  s(3).subs = ':'
