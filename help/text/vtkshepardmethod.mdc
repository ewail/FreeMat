 Usage

vtkShepardMethod is a filter used to visualize unstructured
point data using Shepard's method. The method works by
resampling the unstructured points onto a structured points
set. The influence functions are described as "inverse
distance weighted". Once the structured points are computed,
the usual visualization techniques (e.g., iso-contouring or
volume rendering) can be used visualize the structured
points.
To create an instance of class vtkShepardMethod, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkShepardMethod



 Methods

The class vtkShepardMethod has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkShepardMethod class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkShepardMethod = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkShepardMethod = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* double = obj.ComputeModelBounds (double origin[3], double
  ar[3]) - Compute ModelBounds from input geometry.
* int = obj. GetSampleDimensions () - Specify i-j-
  k dimensions on which to sample input points.
* obj.SetSampleDimensions (int i, int j, int k) - Set the i-
  j-k dimensions on which to sample the distance function.
* obj.SetSampleDimensions (int dim[3]) - Set the i-j-
  k dimensions on which to sample the distance function.
* obj.SetMaximumDistance (double ) - Specify influence
  distance of each input point. This distance is a fraction
  of the length of the diagonal of the sample space. Thus,
  values of 1.0 will cause each input point to influence all
  points in the structured point dataset. Values less than
  1.0 can improve performance significantly.
* double = obj.GetMaximumDistanceMinValue () - Specify
  influence distance of each input point. This distance is a
  fraction of the length of the diagonal of the sample
  space. Thus, values of 1.0 will cause each input point to
  influence all points in the structured point dataset.
  Values less than 1.0 can improve performance
  significantly.
* double = obj.GetMaximumDistanceMaxValue () - Specify
  influence distance of each input point. This distance is a
  fraction of the length of the diagonal of the sample
  space. Thus, values of 1.0 will cause each input point to
  influence all points in the structured point dataset.
  Values less than 1.0 can improve performance
  significantly.
* double = obj.GetMaximumDistance () - Specify influence
  distance of each input point. This distance is a fraction
  of the length of the diagonal of the sample space. Thus,
  values of 1.0 will cause each input point to influence all
  points in the structured point dataset. Values less than
  1.0 can improve performance significantly.
* obj.SetModelBounds (double , double , double , double ,
  double , double ) - Specify the position in space to
  perform the sampling.
* obj.SetModelBounds (double a[6]) - Specify the position in
  space to perform the sampling.
* double = obj. GetModelBounds () - Specify the position in
  space to perform the sampling.
* obj.SetNullValue (double ) - Set the Null value for output
  points not receiving a contribution from the input points.
* double = obj.GetNullValue () - Set the Null value for
  output points not receiving a contribution from the input
  points.
