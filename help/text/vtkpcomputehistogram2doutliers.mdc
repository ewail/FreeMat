 Usage

This class does exactly the same this as
vtkComputeHistogram2DOutliers, but does it in a multi-
process environment. After each node computes their own
local outliers, class does an AllGather that distributes the
outliers to every node. This could probably just be a Gather
onto the root node instead.
After this operation, the row selection will only contain
local row ids, since I'm not sure how to deal with
distributed ids.
To create an instance of class
vtkPComputeHistogram2DOutliers, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkPComputeHistogram2DOutliers



 Methods
