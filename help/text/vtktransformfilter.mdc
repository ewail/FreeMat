 Usage

vtkTransformFilter is a filter to transform point
coordinates, and associated point normals and vectors. Other
point data is passed through the filter.
An alternative method of transformation is to use vtkActor's
methods to scale, rotate, and translate objects. The
difference between the two methods is that vtkActor's
transformation simply effects where objects are rendered
(via the graphics pipeline), whereas vtkTransformFilter
actually modifies point coordinates in the visualization
pipeline. This is necessary for some objects (e.g.,
vtkProbeFilter) that require point coordinates as input.
To create an instance of class vtkTransformFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkTransformFilter



 Methods

The class vtkTransformFilter has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkTransformFilter class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkTransformFilter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkTransformFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* long = obj.GetMTime () - Return the MTime also considering
  the transform.
* obj.SetTransform (vtkAbstractTransform ) - Specify the
  transform object used to transform points.
* vtkAbstractTransform = obj.GetTransform () - Specify the
  transform object used to transform points.
