 Usage

Creates a sparse matrix with uniformly distributed random
entries (on [0,1]). The syntax for its use is

    y = sprand(x)

where x is a sparse matrix, where y is a sparse matrix that
has random entries where x is nonzero. The second form
specifies the size of the matrix and the density

    y = sprand(m,n,density)

where m is the number of rows in the output, n is the number
of columns in the output, and density (which is between 0
and 1) is the density of nonzeros in the resulting matrix.
Note that for very high densities the actual density of the
output matrix may differ from the density you specify. This
difference is a result of the way the random entries into
the matrix are generated. If you need a very dense random
matrix, it is better to generate a full matrix and zero out
the entries you do not need.


 Examples

Here we seed sprand with a full matrix (to demonstrate how
the structure of the output is determined by the input
matrix when using the first form).

  --> x = [1,0,0;0,0,1;1,0,0]

  x =
   1 0 0
   0 0 1
   1 0 0

  --> y = sprand(x)

  y =
   1 1 0.171364
   3 1 0.245464
   2 3 0.0426635
  --> full(y)

  ans =
      0.1714         0         0
           0         0    0.0427
      0.2455         0         0

The more generic version with a density of 0.001. On many
systems the following is impossible using full matrices

  --> y = sprand(10000,10000,.001);
  --> nnz(y)/10000^2

  ans =
   9.9946e-04
