 Usage

vtkXMLShader encapsulates the XML description for a Shader.
It provides convenient access to various attributes/
properties of a shader. .SECTION Thanks Shader support in
VTK includes key contributions by Gary Templet at Sandia
National Labs.
To create an instance of class vtkXMLShader, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkXMLShader



 Methods

The class vtkXMLShader has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkXMLShader class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkXMLShader = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkXMLShader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* vtkXMLDataElement = obj.GetRootElement () - Get/Set the
  XML root element that describes this shader.
* obj.SetRootElement (vtkXMLDataElement ) - Get/Set the XML
  root element that describes this shader.
* int = obj.GetLanguage () - Returns the shader's language
  as defined in the XML description.
* int = obj.GetScope () - Returns the type of the shader as
  defined in the XML description.
* int = obj.GetLocation () - Returns the location of the
  shader as defined in the XML description.
* int = obj.GetStyle () - Returns the style of the shader as
  optionaly defined in the XML description. If not present,
  default style is 1. "style=2" means it is a shader without
  a main(). In style 2, the "main" function for the vertex
  shader part is void propFuncVS(void), the main function
  for the fragment shader part is void propFuncFS(). This is
  useful when combining a shader at the actor level and a
  shader defines at the renderer level, like the depth
  peeling pass.


    Postcondition:
        valid_result: result==1 || result==2

* string = obj.GetName () - Get the name of the Shader.
* string = obj.GetEntry () - Get the entry point to the
  shader code as defined in the XML.
* string = obj.GetCode () - Get the shader code.
