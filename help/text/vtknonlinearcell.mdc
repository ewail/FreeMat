 Usage

vtkNonLinearCell is an abstract superclass for non-linear
cell types. Cells that are a direct subclass of vtkCell or
vtkCell3D are linear; cells that are a subclass of
vtkNonLinearCell have non-linear interpolation functions.
Non-linear cells require special treatment when tessellating
or converting to graphics primitives. Note that the
linearity of the cell is a function of whether the cell
needs tessellation, which does not strictly correlate with
interpolation order (e.g., vtkHexahedron has non-linear
interpolation functions (a product of three linear functions
in r-s-t) even thought vtkHexahedron is considered linear.)
To create an instance of class vtkNonLinearCell, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkNonLinearCell



 Methods

The class vtkNonLinearCell has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkNonLinearCell class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkNonLinearCell = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkNonLinearCell = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* int = obj.IsLinear ()
