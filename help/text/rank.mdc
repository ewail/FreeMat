 Usage

Returns the rank of a matrix. There are two ways to use the
rank function is

     y = rank(A,tol)

where tol is the tolerance to use when computing the rank.
The second form is

     y = rank(A)

in which case the tolerance tol is chosen as

     tol = max(size(A))*max(s)*eps,

where s is the vector of singular values of A. The rank is
computed using the singular value decomposition svd.


 Examples

Some examples of matrix rank calculations

  --> rank([1,3,2;4,5,6])

  ans =
   2

  --> rank([1,2,3;2,4,6])

  ans =
   1

Here we construct an ill-conditioned matrix, and show the
use of the tol argument.

  --> A = [1,0;0,eps/2]

  A =
      1.0000         0
           0    0.0000

  --> rank(A)

  ans =
   1

  --> rank(A,eps/8)

  ans =
   2
