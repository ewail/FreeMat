 Usage

vtkImageNoiseSource just produces images filled with noise.
The only option now is uniform noise specified by a min and
a max. There is one major problem with this source. Every
time it executes, it will output different pixel values.
This has important implications when a stream requests
overlapping regions. The same pixels will have different
values on different updates.
To create an instance of class vtkImageNoiseSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImageNoiseSource



 Methods

The class vtkImageNoiseSource has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkImageNoiseSource class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImageNoiseSource = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImageNoiseSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetMinimum (double ) - Set/Get the minimum and maximum
  values for the generated noise.
* double = obj.GetMinimum () - Set/Get the minimum and
  maximum values for the generated noise.
* obj.SetMaximum (double ) - Set/Get the minimum and maximum
  values for the generated noise.
* double = obj.GetMaximum () - Set/Get the minimum and
  maximum values for the generated noise.
* obj.SetWholeExtent (int xMinx, int xMax, int yMin, int
  yMax, int zMin, int zMax) - Set how large of an image to
  generate.
* obj.SetWholeExtent (int ext[6])
