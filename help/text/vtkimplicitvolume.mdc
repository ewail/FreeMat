 Usage

vtkImplicitVolume treats a volume (e.g., structured point
dataset) as if it were an implicit function. This means it
computes a function value and gradient. vtkImplicitVolume is
a concrete implementation of vtkImplicitFunction.
vtkImplicitDataSet computes the function (at the point x) by
performing cell interpolation. That is, it finds the cell
containing x, and then uses the cell's interpolation
functions to compute an interpolated scalar value at x. (A
similar approach is used to find the gradient, if
requested.) Points outside of the dataset are assigned the
value of the ivar OutValue, and the gradient value
OutGradient.
To create an instance of class vtkImplicitVolume, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImplicitVolume



 Methods

The class vtkImplicitVolume has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkImplicitVolume class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImplicitVolume = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImplicitVolume = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* long = obj.GetMTime () - Returns the mtime also
  considering the volume. This also calls Update on the
  volume, and it therefore must be called before the
  function is evaluated.
* double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x[3])
* double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x, double y, double
  z)
* obj.EvaluateGradient (double x[3], double n[3])
* obj.SetVolume (vtkImageData ) - Specify the volume for the
  implicit function.
* vtkImageData = obj.GetVolume () - Specify the volume for
  the implicit function.
* obj.SetOutValue (double ) - Set the function value to use
  for points outside of the dataset.
* double = obj.GetOutValue () - Set the function value to
  use for points outside of the dataset.
* obj.SetOutGradient (double , double , double ) - Set the
  function gradient to use for points outside of the
  dataset.
* obj.SetOutGradient (double a[3]) - Set the function
  gradient to use for points outside of the dataset.
* double = obj. GetOutGradient () - Set the function
  gradient to use for points outside of the dataset.
