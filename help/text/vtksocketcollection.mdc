 Usage

Apart from being vtkCollection subclass for sockets, this
class provides means to wait for activity on all the sockets
in the collection simultaneously.
To create an instance of class vtkSocketCollection, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSocketCollection



 Methods

The class vtkSocketCollection has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkSocketCollection class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSocketCollection = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSocketCollection = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.AddItem (vtkSocket soc)
* int = obj.SelectSockets (long msec) - Select all Connected
  sockets in the collection. If msec is specified, it
  timesout after msec milliseconds on inactivity. Returns 0
  on timeout, -1 on error; 1 is a socket was selected. The
  selected socket can be retrieved by GetLastSelectedSocket
  ().
* vtkSocket = obj.GetLastSelectedSocket () - Overridden to
  unset SelectedSocket.
* obj.ReplaceItem (int i, vtkObject ) - Overridden to unset
  SelectedSocket.
* obj.RemoveItem (int i) - Overridden to unset
  SelectedSocket.
* obj.RemoveItem (vtkObject ) - Overridden to unset
  SelectedSocket.
* obj.RemoveAllItems () - Overridden to unset
  SelectedSocket.
