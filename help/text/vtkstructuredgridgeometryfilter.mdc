 Usage

vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter is a filter that extracts
geometry from a structured grid. By specifying appropriate
i-j-k indices, it is possible to extract a point, a curve, a
surface, or a "volume". Depending upon the type of data, the
curve and surface may be curved or planar. (The volume is
actually a (n x m x o) region of points.)
The extent specification is zero-offset. That is, the first
k-plane in a 50x50x50 structured grid is given by (0,49,
0,49, 0,0).
The output of this filter is affected by the structured grid
blanking. If blanking is on, and a blanking array defined,
then those cells attached to blanked points are not output.
(Blanking is a property of the input vtkStructuredGrid.)
To create an instance of class
vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter



 Methods

The class vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter has several
methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that
the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o)
* int = obj. GetExtent () - Get the extent in topological
  coordinate range (imin,imax, jmin,jmax, kmin,kmax).
* obj.SetExtent (int iMin, int iMax, int jMin, int jMax, int
  kMin, int kMax) - Specify (imin,imax, jmin,jmax,
  kmin,kmax) indices.
* obj.SetExtent (int extent[6]) - Specify (imin,imax,
  jmin,jmax, kmin,kmax) indices in array form.
