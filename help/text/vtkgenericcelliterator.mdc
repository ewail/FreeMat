 Usage

This class (and subclasses) are used to iterate over cells.
Use it only in conjunction with vtkGenericDataSet (i.e., the
adaptor framework).
Typical use is:

   vtkGenericDataSet *dataset;
   vtkGenericCellIterator *it = dataset->NewCellIterator(2);
   for (it->Begin(); !it->IsAtEnd(); it->Next());
     {
     spec=it->GetCell();
     }

To create an instance of class vtkGenericCellIterator,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkGenericCellIterator



 Methods

The class vtkGenericCellIterator has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkGenericCellIterator class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard VTK construction
  and type macros.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard VTK construction
  and type macros.
* vtkGenericCellIterator = obj.NewInstance () - Standard VTK
  construction and type macros.
* vtkGenericCellIterator = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o) -
  Standard VTK construction and type macros.
* obj.Begin () - Move iterator to first position if any
  (loop initialization).
* int = obj.IsAtEnd () - Is the iterator at the end of
  traversal?
* vtkGenericAdaptorCell = obj.NewCell () - Create an empty
  cell. The user is responsible for deleting it.


    Postcondition:
        result_exists: result!=0

* obj.GetCell (vtkGenericAdaptorCell c) - Get the cell at
  current position. The cell should be instantiated with the
  NewCell() method.


    Precondition:
        not_at_end: !IsAtEnd()
        c_exists: c!=0 THREAD SAFE

* vtkGenericAdaptorCell = obj.GetCell () - Get the cell at
  the current traversal position. NOT THREAD SAFE


    Precondition:
        not_at_end: !IsAtEnd()



    Postcondition:
        result_exits: result!=0

* obj.Next () - Move the iterator to the next position in
  the list.


    Precondition:
        not_at_end: !IsAtEnd()
