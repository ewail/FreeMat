 Usage

The return statement is used to immediately return from a
function, or to return from a keyboard session. The syntax
for its use is

    return

Inside a function, a return statement causes FreeMat to exit
the function immediately. When a keyboard session is active,
the return statement causes execution to resume where the
keyboard session started.


 Example

In the first example, we define a function that uses a
return to exit the function if a certain test condition is
satisfied.

       return_func.m


  function ret = return_func(a,b)
    ret = 'a is greater';
    if (a > b)
      return;
    end
    ret = 'b is greater';
    printf('finishing up...\n');

Next we exercise the function with a few simple test cases:

  --> return_func(1,3)
  finishing up...

  ans =
  b is greater
  --> return_func(5,2)

  ans =
  a is greater

In the second example, we take the function and rewrite it
to use a keyboard statement inside the if statement.

       return_func2.m


  function ret = return_func2(a,b)
    if (a > b)
       ret = 'a is greater';
       keyboard;
    else
       ret = 'b is greater';
    end
    printf('finishing up...\n');

Now, we call the function with a larger first argument,
which triggers the keyboard session. After verifying a few
values inside the keyboard session, we issue a return
statement to resume execution.

  --> return_func2(2,4)
  finishing up...

  ans =
  b is greater
  --> return_func2(5,1)
  [return_func2,4]--> ret

  ans =
  a is greater
  [return_func2,4]--> a

  ans =
   5

  [return_func2,4]--> b

  ans =
   1

  [return_func2,4]--> return
  finishing up...

  ans =
  a is greater
