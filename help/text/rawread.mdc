 Usage

The syntax for rawread is

     function x = rawread(fname,size,precision,byteorder)

where fname is the name of the file to read from, and size
is an n-dimensional vector that stores the size of the array
in each dimension. The argument precision is the type of the
data to read in:

* 'uint8','uchar','unsigned char' for unsigned, 8-bit
  integers
* 'int8','char','integer*1' for signed, 8-bit integers
* 'uint16','unsigned short' for unsigned, 16-bit integers
* 'int16','short','integer*2' for signed, 16-bit integers
* 'uint32','unsigned int' for unsigned, 32-bit integers
* 'int32','int','integer*4' for signed, 32-bit integers
* 'uint64','unsigned int' for unsigned, 64-bit integers
* 'int64','int','integer*8' for signed, 64-bit integers
* 'single','float32','float','real*4' for 32-bit floating
  point
* 'double','float64','real*8' for 64-bit floating point
* 'complex','complex*8' for 64-bit complex floating point
  (32 bits for the real and imaginary part).
* 'dcomplex','complex*16' for 128-bit complex floating point
  (64 bits for the real and imaginary part).

As a special feature, one of the size elements can be 'inf',
in which case, the largest possible array is read in. If
byteorder is left unspecified, the file is assumed to be of
the same byte-order as the machine FreeMat is running on. If
you wish to force a particular byte order, specify the
byteorder argument as

* 'le','ieee-le','little-endian','littleEndian','little'
* 'be','ieee-be','big-endian','bigEndian','big'
