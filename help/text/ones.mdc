 Usage

Creates an array of ones of the specified size. Two seperate
syntaxes are possible. The first syntax specifies the array
dimensions as a sequence of scalar dimensions:

     y = ones(d1,d2,...,dn).

The resulting array has the given dimensions, and is filled
with all ones. The type of y is float, a 32-bit floating
point array. To get arrays of other types, use the typecast
functions (e.g., uint8, int8, etc.).
The second syntax specifies the array dimensions as a
vector, where each element in the vector specifies a
dimension length:

     y = ones([d1,d2,...,dn]).

This syntax is more convenient for calling ones using a
variable for the argument. In both cases, specifying only
one dimension results in a square matrix output.


 Example

The following examples demonstrate generation of some arrays
of ones using the first form.

  --> ones(2,3,2)

  ans =

  (:,:,1) =
   1 1 1
   1 1 1

  (:,:,2) =
   1 1 1
   1 1 1

  --> ones(1,3)

  ans =
   1 1 1

The same expressions, using the second form.

  --> ones([2,6])

  ans =
   1 1 1 1 1 1
   1 1 1 1 1 1

  --> ones([1,3])

  ans =
   1 1 1

Finally, an example of using the type casting function
uint16 to generate an array of 16-bit unsigned integers with
a value of 1.

  --> uint16(ones(3))

  ans =
   1 1 1
   1 1 1
   1 1 1
