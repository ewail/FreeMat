 Usage

The cell array is a fairly powerful array type that is
available in FreeMat. Generally speaking, a cell array is a
heterogenous array type, meaning that different elements in
the array can contain variables of different type (including
other cell arrays). For those of you familiar with C, it is
the equivalent to the void * array. The general syntax for
their construction is

     A = {row_def1;row_def2;...;row_defN}

where each row consists of one or more elements, seperated
by commas

    row_defi = element_i1,element_i2,...,element_iM

Each element can be any type of FreeMat variable, including
matrices, arrays, cell-arrays, structures, strings, etc. The
restriction on the definition is that each row must have the
same number of elements in it.


 Examples

Here is an example of a cell-array that contains a number, a
string, and an array

  --> A = {14,'hello',[1:10]}

  A =
   [14] [hello] [1x10 double array]

Note that in the output, the number and string are
explicitly printed, but the array is summarized. We can
create a 2-dimensional cell-array by adding another row
definition

  --> B = {pi,i;e,-1}

  B =
   [3.14159] [0+1i]
   [2.71828] [-1]

Finally, we create a new cell array by placing A and B
together

  --> C = {A,B}

  C =
   [1x3 cell array] [2x2 cell array]
