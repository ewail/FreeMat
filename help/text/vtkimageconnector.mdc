 Usage

vtkImageConnector is a helper class for connectivity
filters. It is not meant to be used directly. It implements
a stack and breadth first search necessary for some
connectivity filters. Filtered axes sets the dimensionality
of the neighbor comparison, and cannot be more than three
dimensions. As implemented, only voxels which share faces
are considered neighbors.
To create an instance of class vtkImageConnector, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImageConnector



 Methods

The class vtkImageConnector has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkImageConnector class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImageConnector = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImageConnector = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.RemoveAllSeeds ()
* obj.SetConnectedValue (char ) - Values used by the
  MarkRegion method
* char = obj.GetConnectedValue () - Values used by the
  MarkRegion method
* obj.SetUnconnectedValue (char ) - Values used by the
  MarkRegion method
* char = obj.GetUnconnectedValue () - Values used by the
  MarkRegion method
* obj.MarkData (vtkImageData data, int dimensionality, int
  ext[6]) - Input a data of 0's and "UnconnectedValue"s.
  Seeds of this object are used to find connected pixels.
  All pixels connected to seeds are set to ConnectedValue.
  The data has to be unsigned char.
