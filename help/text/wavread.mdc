 Usage

The wavread function (attempts) to read the contents of a
linear PCM audio WAV file. This function could definitely
use improvements - it is based on a very simplistic notion
of a WAV file. The simplest form for its use is

     y = wavread(filename)

where filename is the name of the WAV file to read. If no
extension is provided, FreeMat will add a '.wav' extension.
This loads the data from the WAV file into y, and returns it
in double precision, normalized format. If you want
additional information on, for example, the WAV sampling
rate or bit depth, you can request it via

    [y, SamplingRate, BitDepth] = wavread(filename)

where SamplingRate and BitDepth are the sampling rate (in
Hz) and the bit depth of the original data in the WAV file.
If you only want to load part of the WAV file, you can use

    [...] = wavread(filename, N)

where N indicates the number of samples to read from the
file. Alternately, you can indicate a range of samples to
load via

    [...] = wavread(filename, [N1 N2])

which returns only the indicated samples from each channel
in the file. By default, the output format is double
precision. You can cntrol the format of the output by
indicating

    [...] = wavread(filename, format)

where format is either 'double' for double precision output,
or 'native' for native precision output (meaning whatever
bitdepth that was present in the original file). Finally,
you can use the 'size' flag

    y_siz = wavread(filename,'size')

which returns a vector [samples channels] indicating the
size of the data present in the WAV file.
