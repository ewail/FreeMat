 Usage

vtkFeatureEdges is a filter to extract special types of
edges from input polygonal data. These edges are either 1)
boundary (used by one polygon) or a line cell; 2) non-
manifold (used by three or more polygons); 3) feature edges
(edges used by two triangles and whose dihedral angle >
FeatureAngle); or 4) manifold edges (edges used by exactly
two polygons). These edges may be extracted in any
combination. Edges may also be "colored" (i.e., scalar
values assigned) based on edge type. The cell coloring is
assigned to the cell data of the extracted edges.
To create an instance of class vtkFeatureEdges, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkFeatureEdges



 Methods

The class vtkFeatureEdges has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkFeatureEdges class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkFeatureEdges = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkFeatureEdges = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)

  of boundary edges.
* int = obj.GetBoundaryEdges () - Turn on/off the extraction
  of boundary edges.

  type.
* obj.SetLocator (vtkIncrementalPointLocator locator) - Set
  / get a spatial locator for merging points. By default an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
* vtkIncrementalPointLocator = obj.GetLocator () - Set / get
  a spatial locator for merging points. By default an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
