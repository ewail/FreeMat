 Usage

This method is called for classes in the expressions of the
form

    c = subsindex(a)

where a is an object, and c is an index vector. It is also
called for

    c = b(a)

in which case subsindex(a) must return a vector containing
integers between 0 and N-1 where N is the number of elements
in the vector b.
