 Usage

The hilbert function computes the hilbert transform of the
argument vector or matrix. The FreeMat hilbert function is
compatible with the one from the MATLAB API. This means that
the output of the hilbert function is the sum of the
original function and an imaginary signal containing the
Hilbert transform of it. There are two syntaxes for the
hilbert function. The first is

    y = hilbert(x)

where x is real vector or matrix. If x is a matrix, then he
Hilbert transform is computed along the columns of x. The
second syntax provides a dimension along which to take the
transform.

    y = hilbert(x,n)

where n is the dimension along which to apply the
transformation.
