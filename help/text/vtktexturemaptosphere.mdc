 Usage

vtkTextureMapToSphere is a filter that generates 2D texture
coordinates by mapping input dataset points onto a sphere.
The sphere can either be user specified or generated
automatically. (The sphere is generated automatically by
computing the center (i.e., averaged coordinates) of the
sphere.) Note that the generated texture coordinates range
between (0,1). The s-coordinate lies in the angular
direction around the z-axis, measured counter-clockwise from
the x-axis. The t-coordinate lies in the angular direction
measured down from the north pole towards the south pole.
A special ivar controls how the s-coordinate is generated.
If PreventSeam is set to true, the s-texture varies from 0-
>1 and then 1->0 (corresponding to angles of 0->180 and 180-
>360).
To create an instance of class vtkTextureMapToSphere, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkTextureMapToSphere



 Methods

The class vtkTextureMapToSphere has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkTextureMapToSphere class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkTextureMapToSphere = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkTextureMapToSphere = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetCenter (double , double , double ) - Specify a
  point defining the center of the sphere.
* obj.SetCenter (double a[3]) - Specify a point defining the
  center of the sphere.
* double = obj. GetCenter () - Specify a point defining the
  center of the sphere.
* obj.SetAutomaticSphereGeneration (int ) - Turn on/off
  automatic sphere generation. This means it automatically
  finds the sphere center.
* int = obj.GetAutomaticSphereGeneration () - Turn on/off
  automatic sphere generation. This means it automatically
  finds the sphere center.
* obj.AutomaticSphereGenerationOn () - Turn on/off automatic
  sphere generation. This means it automatically finds the
  sphere center.
* obj.AutomaticSphereGenerationOff () - Turn on/off
  automatic sphere generation. This means it automatically
  finds the sphere center.
* obj.SetPreventSeam (int ) - Control how the texture
  coordinates are generated. If PreventSeam is set, the s-
  coordinate ranges from 0->1 and 1->0 corresponding to the
  theta angle variation between 0->180 and 180->0 degrees.
  Otherwise, the s-coordinate ranges from 0->1 between 0-
  >360 degrees.
* int = obj.GetPreventSeam () - Control how the texture
  coordinates are generated. If PreventSeam is set, the s-
  coordinate ranges from 0->1 and 1->0 corresponding to the
  theta angle variation between 0->180 and 180->0 degrees.
  Otherwise, the s-coordinate ranges from 0->1 between 0-
  >360 degrees.
* obj.PreventSeamOn () - Control how the texture coordinates
  are generated. If PreventSeam is set, the s-coordinate
  ranges from 0->1 and 1->0 corresponding to the theta angle
  variation between 0->180 and 180->0 degrees. Otherwise,
  the s-coordinate ranges from 0->1 between 0->360 degrees.
* obj.PreventSeamOff () - Control how the texture
  coordinates are generated. If PreventSeam is set, the s-
  coordinate ranges from 0->1 and 1->0 corresponding to the
  theta angle variation between 0->180 and 180->0 degrees.
  Otherwise, the s-coordinate ranges from 0->1 between 0-
  >360 degrees.
