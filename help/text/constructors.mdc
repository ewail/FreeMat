 Usage

When designing a constructor for a FreeMat class, you should
design the constructor to take a certain form. The following
is the code for the sample mat object

  function p = mat(a)
    if (nargin == 0)
      p.c = [];
      p = class(p,'mat');
    elseif isa(a,'mat')
      p = a;
    else
      p.c = a;
      p = class(p,'mat');
    end

Generally speaking when it is provided with zero arguments,
the constructor returns a default version of the class using
a template structure with the right fields populated with
default values. If the constructor is given a single
argument that matches the class we are trying to construct,
the constructor passes through the argument. This form of
the constructor is used for type conversion. In particular,

     p = mat(a)

guarantees that p is an array of class mat. The last form of
the constructor builds a class object given the input. The
meaning of this form depends on what makes sense for your
class. For example, for a polynomial class, you may want to
pass in the coefficients of the polynomial.
