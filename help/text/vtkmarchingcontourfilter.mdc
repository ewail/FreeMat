 Usage

vtkMarchingContourFilter is a filter that takes as input any
dataset and generates on output isosurfaces and/or isolines.
The exact form of the output depends upon the dimensionality
of the input data. Data consisting of 3D cells will generate
isosurfaces, data consisting of 2D cells will generate
isolines, and data with 1D or 0D cells will generate
isopoints. Combinations of output type are possible if the
input dimension is mixed.
This filter will identify special dataset types (e.g.,
structured points) and use the appropriate specialized
filter to process the data. For examples, if the input
dataset type is a volume, this filter will create an
internal vtkMarchingCubes instance and use it. This gives
much better performance.
To use this filter you must specify one or more contour
values. You can either use the method SetValue() to specify
each contour value, or use GenerateValues() to generate a
series of evenly spaced contours. It is also possible to
accelerate the operation of this filter (at the cost of
extra memory) by using a vtkScalarTree. A scalar tree is
used to quickly locate cells that contain a contour surface.
This is especially effective if multiple contours are being
extracted. If you want to use a scalar tree, invoke the
method UseScalarTreeOn().
To create an instance of class vtkMarchingContourFilter,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkMarchingContourFilter



 Methods

The class vtkMarchingContourFilter has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkMarchingContourFilter class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkMarchingContourFilter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkMarchingContourFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetValue (int i, double value) - Methods to set / get
  contour values.
* double = obj.GetValue (int i) - Methods to set / get
  contour values.
* obj.GetValues (double contourValues) - Methods to set /
  get contour values.
* obj.SetNumberOfContours (int number) - Methods to set /
  get contour values.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfContours () - Methods to set / get
  contour values.
* obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double range[2]) -
  Methods to set / get contour values.
* obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double rangeStart,
  double rangeEnd) - Methods to set / get contour values.
* long = obj.GetMTime () - Modified GetMTime Because we
  delegate to vtkContourValues
* obj.SetComputeNormals (int ) - Set/Get the computation of
  normals. Normal computation is fairly expensive in both
  time and storage. If the output data will be processed by
  filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be wise
  to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* int = obj.GetComputeNormals () - Set/Get the computation
  of normals. Normal computation is fairly expensive in both
  time and storage. If the output data will be processed by
  filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be wise
  to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.ComputeNormalsOn () - Set/Get the computation of
  normals. Normal computation is fairly expensive in both
  time and storage. If the output data will be processed by
  filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be wise
  to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.ComputeNormalsOff () - Set/Get the computation of
  normals. Normal computation is fairly expensive in both
  time and storage. If the output data will be processed by
  filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be wise
  to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.SetComputeGradients (int ) - Set/Get the computation
  of gradients. Gradient computation is fairly expensive in
  both time and storage. Note that if ComputeNormals is on,
  gradients will have to be calculated, but will not be
  stored in the output dataset. If the output data will be
  processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it
  may be wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* int = obj.GetComputeGradients () - Set/Get the computation
  of gradients. Gradient computation is fairly expensive in
  both time and storage. Note that if ComputeNormals is on,
  gradients will have to be calculated, but will not be
  stored in the output dataset. If the output data will be
  processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it
  may be wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.ComputeGradientsOn () - Set/Get the computation of
  gradients. Gradient computation is fairly expensive in
  both time and storage. Note that if ComputeNormals is on,
  gradients will have to be calculated, but will not be
  stored in the output dataset. If the output data will be
  processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it
  may be wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.ComputeGradientsOff () - Set/Get the computation of
  gradients. Gradient computation is fairly expensive in
  both time and storage. Note that if ComputeNormals is on,
  gradients will have to be calculated, but will not be
  stored in the output dataset. If the output data will be
  processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it
  may be wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
* obj.SetComputeScalars (int ) - Set/Get the computation of

  tree to accelerate contour extraction.
* obj.UseScalarTreeOn () - Enable the use of a scalar tree
  to accelerate contour extraction.
* obj.UseScalarTreeOff () - Enable the use of a scalar tree
  to accelerate contour extraction.
* obj.SetLocator (vtkIncrementalPointLocator locator) - Set
  / get a spatial locator for merging points. By default, an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
* vtkIncrementalPointLocator = obj.GetLocator () - Set / get
  a spatial locator for merging points. By default, an
  instance of vtkMergePoints is used.
* obj.CreateDefaultLocator () - Create default locator. Used
  to create one when none is specified. The locator is used
  to merge coincident points.
