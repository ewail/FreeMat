 Usage

vtkImageStencilSource is a superclass for filters that
generate image stencils. Given a clipping object such as a
vtkImplicitFunction, it will set up a list of clipping
extents for each x-row through the image data. The extents
for each x-row can be retrieved via the GetNextExtent()
method after the extent lists have been built with the
BuildExtents() method. For large images, using clipping
extents is much more memory efficient (and slightly more
time-efficient) than building a mask. This class can be
subclassed to allow clipping with objects other than
vtkImplicitFunction.
To create an instance of class vtkImageStencilSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImageStencilSource



 Methods

The class vtkImageStencilSource has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkImageStencilSource class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImageStencilSource = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImageStencilSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetOutput (vtkImageStencilData output) - Get or set
  the output for this source.
* vtkImageStencilData = obj.GetOutput () - Get or set the
  output for this source.
