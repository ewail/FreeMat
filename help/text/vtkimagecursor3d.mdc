 Usage

vtkImageCursor3D will draw a cursor on a 2d image or 3d
volume.
To create an instance of class vtkImageCursor3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkImageCursor3D



 Methods

The class vtkImageCursor3D has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkImageCursor3D class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImageCursor3D = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImageCursor3D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetCursorPosition (double , double , double ) - Sets/
  Gets the center point of the 3d cursor.
* obj.SetCursorPosition (double a[3]) - Sets/Gets the center
  point of the 3d cursor.
* double = obj. GetCursorPosition () - Sets/Gets the center
  point of the 3d cursor.
* obj.SetCursorValue (double ) - Sets/Gets what pixel value
  to draw the cursor in.
* double = obj.GetCursorValue () - Sets/Gets what pixel
  value to draw the cursor in.
* obj.SetCursorRadius (int ) - Sets/Gets the radius of the
  cursor. The radius determines how far the axis lines
  project out from the cursors center.
* int = obj.GetCursorRadius () - Sets/Gets the radius of the
  cursor. The radius determines how far the axis lines
  project out from the cursors center.
