 Usage

vtkPolyDataStreamer initiates streaming by requesting pieces
from its single input it appends these pieces it to the
requested output. Note that since vtkPolyDataStreamer uses
an append filter, all the polygons generated have to be kept
in memory before rendering. If these do not fit in the
memory, it is possible to make the vtkPolyDataMapper stream.
Since the mapper will render each piece separately, all the
polygons do not have to stored in memory. .SECTION Note The
output may be slightly different if the pipeline does not
handle ghost cells properly (i.e. you might see seames
between the pieces).
To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataStreamer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkPolyDataStreamer



 Methods

The class vtkPolyDataStreamer has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkPolyDataStreamer class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkPolyDataStreamer = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkPolyDataStreamer = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetNumberOfStreamDivisions (int num) - Set the number
  of pieces to divide the problem into.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfStreamDivisions () - Set the number
  of pieces to divide the problem into.
* obj.SetColorByPiece (int ) - By default, this option is
  off. When it is on, cell scalars are generated based on
  which piece they are in.
* int = obj.GetColorByPiece () - By default, this option is
  off. When it is on, cell scalars are generated based on
  which piece they are in.
* obj.ColorByPieceOn () - By default, this option is off.
  When it is on, cell scalars are generated based on which
  piece they are in.
* obj.ColorByPieceOff () - By default, this option is off.
  When it is on, cell scalars are generated based on which
  piece they are in.
