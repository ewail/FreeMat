 Usage

vtkTextMapper provides 2D text annotation support for VTK.
It is a vtkMapper2D that can be associated with a vtkActor2D
and placed into a vtkRenderer.
To use vtkTextMapper, specify an input text string.
To create an instance of class vtkTextMapper, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkTextMapper



 Methods

The class vtkTextMapper has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkTextMapper class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkTextMapper = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkTextMapper = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.GetSize (vtkViewport , int size[2]) - Return the size
  [2]/width/height of the rectangle required to draw this
  mapper (in pixels).
* int = obj.GetWidth (vtkViewport v) - Return the size[2]/
  width/height of the rectangle required to draw this mapper
  (in pixels).
* int = obj.GetHeight (vtkViewport v) - Return the size[2]/
  width/height of the rectangle required to draw this mapper
  (in pixels).
* obj.SetInput (string inputString) - Set the input text
  string to the mapper. The mapper recognizes "\n" as a
  carriage return/linefeed (line separator).
* string = obj.GetInput () - Set the input text string to
  the mapper. The mapper recognizes "\n" as a carriage
  return/linefeed (line separator).
* obj.SetTextProperty (vtkTextProperty p) - Set/Get the text
  property.
* vtkTextProperty = obj.GetTextProperty () - Set/Get the
  text property.
* obj.ShallowCopy (vtkTextMapper tm) - Shallow copy of an
  actor.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfLines (string input) - Determine the
  number of lines in the input string (delimited by "\n").
* int = obj.GetNumberOfLines () - Get the number of lines in
  the input string (the method GetNumberOfLines(char*) must
  have been previously called for the return value to be
  valid).
* int = obj.SetConstrainedFontSize (vtkViewport , int
  targetWidth, int targetHeight) - Set and return the font
  size required to make this mapper fit in a given target
  rectangle (width x height, in pixels). A static version of
  the method is also available for convenience to other
  classes (e.g., widgets).
* int = obj.GetSystemFontSize (int size)
