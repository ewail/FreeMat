 Usage

vtkBMPReader is a source object that reads Windows BMP
files. This includes indexed and 24bit bitmaps Usually, all
BMPs are converted to 24bit RGB, but BMPs may be output as
8bit images with a LookupTable if the Allow8BitBMP flag is
set.
BMPReader creates structured point datasets. The dimension
of the dataset depends upon the number of files read.
Reading a single file results in a 2D image, while reading
more than one file results in a 3D volume.
To read a volume, files must be of the form
"FileName.<number>" (e.g., foo.bmp.0, foo.bmp.1, ...). You
must also specify the image range. This range specifies the
beginning and ending files to read (range can be any pair of
non-negative numbers).
The default behavior is to read a single file. In this case,
the form of the file is simply "FileName" (e.g., foo.bmp).
To create an instance of class vtkBMPReader, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkBMPReader



 Methods

The class vtkBMPReader has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkBMPReader class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkBMPReader = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkBMPReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* int = obj.GetDepth () - Returns the depth of the BMP,
  either 8 or 24.
* int = obj.CanReadFile (string fname) - Is the given file a
  BMP file?
* string = obj.GetFileExtensions () - Return a descriptive
  name for the file format that might be useful in a GUI.
* string = obj.GetDescriptiveName () - If this flag is set
  and the BMP reader encounters an 8bit file, the data will
  be kept as unsigned chars and a lookuptable will be
  exported
* obj.SetAllow8BitBMP (int ) - If this flag is set and the
  BMP reader encounters an 8bit file, the data will be kept
  as unsigned chars and a lookuptable will be exported
* int = obj.GetAllow8BitBMP () - If this flag is set and the
  BMP reader encounters an 8bit file, the data will be kept
  as unsigned chars and a lookuptable will be exported
* obj.Allow8BitBMPOn () - If this flag is set and the BMP
  reader encounters an 8bit file, the data will be kept as
  unsigned chars and a lookuptable will be exported
* obj.Allow8BitBMPOff () - If this flag is set and the BMP
  reader encounters an 8bit file, the data will be kept as
  unsigned chars and a lookuptable will be exported
* vtkLookupTable = obj.GetLookupTable ()
