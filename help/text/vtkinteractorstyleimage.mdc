 Usage

vtkInteractorStyleImage allows the user to interactively
manipulate (rotate, pan, zoomm etc.) the camera.
vtkInteractorStyleImage is specially designed to work with
images that are being rendered with vtkImageActor. Several
events are overloaded from its superclass
vtkInteractorStyle, hence the mouse bindings are different.
(The bindings keep the camera's view plane normal
perpendicular to the x-y plane.) In summary the mouse events
are as follows:

* Left Mouse button triggers window level events
* CTRL Left Mouse spins the camera around its view plane
  normal
* SHIFT Left Mouse pans the camera
* CTRL SHIFT Left Mouse dollys (a positional zoom) the
  camera
* Middle mouse button pans the camera
* Right mouse button dollys the camera.
* SHIFT Right Mouse triggers pick events

Note that the renderer's actors are not moved; instead the
camera is moved.
To create an instance of class vtkInteractorStyleImage,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkInteractorStyleImage



 Methods

The class vtkInteractorStyleImage has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkInteractorStyleImage class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkInteractorStyleImage = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkInteractorStyleImage = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* int = obj. GetWindowLevelStartPosition () - Some useful
  information for handling window level
* int = obj. GetWindowLevelCurrentPosition () - Some useful
  information for handling window level
* obj.OnMouseMove () - Event bindings controlling the
  effects of pressing mouse buttons or moving the mouse.
* obj.OnLeftButtonDown () - Event bindings controlling the
  effects of pressing mouse buttons or moving the mouse.
* obj.OnLeftButtonUp () - Event bindings controlling the
  effects of pressing mouse buttons or moving the mouse.
* obj.OnRightButtonDown () - Event bindings controlling the
  effects of pressing mouse buttons or moving the mouse.
* obj.OnRightButtonUp () - Event bindings controlling the
  effects of pressing mouse buttons or moving the mouse.
* obj.OnChar () - Override the "fly-to" (f keypress) for
  images.
* obj.WindowLevel ()
* obj.Pick ()
* obj.StartWindowLevel ()
* obj.EndWindowLevel ()
* obj.StartPick ()
* obj.EndPick ()
