 Usage

Performs a bitwise binary or operation on the two arguments
and returns the result. The syntax for its use is

     y = bitor(a,b)

where a and b are multi-dimensional unsigned integer arrays.
The and operation is performed using 32 bit unsigned
intermediates. Note that if a or b is a scalar, then each
element of the other array is or'ed with that scalar.
Otherwise the two arrays must match in size.


 Example


  --> bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16([3,17,128]))

  ans =
     1  16 128

  --> bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16(3))

  ans =
   1 0 3
