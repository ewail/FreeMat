 Usage

This class (and subclasses) are used to iterate over points.
Use it only in conjunction with vtkGenericDataSet (i.e., the
adaptor framework).
Typical use is:

   vtkGenericDataSet *dataset;
   vtkGenericPointIterator *it = dataset->NewPointIterator
  ();
   for (it->Begin(); !it->IsAtEnd(); it->Next());
     {
     x=it->GetPosition();
     }

To create an instance of class vtkGenericPointIterator,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkGenericPointIterator



 Methods

The class vtkGenericPointIterator has several methods that
can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkGenericPointIterator class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard VTK construction
  and type macros.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard VTK construction
  and type macros.
* vtkGenericPointIterator = obj.NewInstance () - Standard
  VTK construction and type macros.
* vtkGenericPointIterator = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o) -
  Standard VTK construction and type macros.
* obj.Begin () - Move iterator to first position if any
  (loop initialization).
* int = obj.IsAtEnd () - Is the iterator at the end of
  traversal?
* obj.Next () - Move the iterator to the next position in
  the list.


    Precondition:
        not_off: !IsAtEnd()

* obj.GetPosition (double x[3]) - Get the coordinates of the
  point at the current iterator position.


    Precondition:
        not_off: !IsAtEnd()
        x_exists: x!=0

* vtkIdType = obj.GetId () - Return the unique identifier
  for the point, could be non-contiguous.


    Precondition:
        not_off: !IsAtEnd()
