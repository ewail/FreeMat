 Usage

A synonym for the float function, converts the argument to a
32-bit floating point number. The syntax for its use is

     y = single(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array. Conversion
follows the general C rules. Note that both NaN and Inf are
both preserved under type conversion.
