 Usage

vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression Sets to zero any pixel that is
not a peak. If a pixel has a neighbor along the vector that
has larger magnitude, the smaller pixel is set to zero. The
filter takes two inputs: a magnitude and a vector. Output is
magnitude information and is always in doubles. Typically
this filter is used with vtkImageGradient and
vtkImageGradientMagnitude as inputs.
To create an instance of class
vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression, simply invoke its constructor
as follows

    obj = vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression



 Methods

The class vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression has several methods
that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetMagnitudeInput (vtkImageData input) - Set the
  magnitude and vector inputs.
* obj.SetVectorInput (vtkImageData input) - Set the
  magnitude and vector inputs.
* obj.SetHandleBoundaries (int ) - If "HandleBoundariesOn"
  then boundary pixels are duplicated So central differences
  can get values.
* int = obj.GetHandleBoundaries () - If "HandleBoundariesOn"
  then boundary pixels are duplicated So central differences
  can get values.
* obj.HandleBoundariesOn () - If "HandleBoundariesOn" then
  boundary pixels are duplicated So central differences can
  get values.
* obj.HandleBoundariesOff () - If "HandleBoundariesOn" then
  boundary pixels are duplicated So central differences can
  get values.
* obj.SetDimensionality (int ) - Determines how the input is
  interpreted (set of 2d slices or a 3D volume)
* int = obj.GetDimensionalityMinValue () - Determines how
  the input is interpreted (set of 2d slices or a 3D volume)
* int = obj.GetDimensionalityMaxValue () - Determines how
  the input is interpreted (set of 2d slices or a 3D volume)
* int = obj.GetDimensionality () - Determines how the input
  is interpreted (set of 2d slices or a 3D volume)
