 Usage

vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator interpolates and
places contour points on images. The class interpolates
nodes by computing a graph lying on the image data. By
graph, we mean that the line interpolating the two end
points traverses along pixels so as to form a shortest path.
A Dijkstra algorithm is used to compute the path.
The class is meant to be used in conjunction with
vtkImageActorPointPlacer. One reason for this coupling is a
performance issue: both classes need to perform a cell pick,
and coupling avoids multiple cell picks (cell picks are
slow). Another issue is that the interpolator may need to
set the image input to its vtkDijkstraImageGeodesicPath
ivar.
To create an instance of class
vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator



 Methods

The class vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator has
several methods that can be used. They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from
the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible.
When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods
listed below, obj is an instance of the
vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard methods for
  instances of this class.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard methods for
  instances of this class.
* vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator = obj.NewInstance
  () - Standard methods for instances of this class.
* vtkDijkstraImageContourLineInterpolator = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o) - Standard methods for instances of this
  class.
* int = obj.InterpolateLine (vtkRenderer ren,
  vtkContourRepresentation rep, int idx1, int idx2) -
  Subclasses that wish to interpolate a line segment must
  implement this. For instance
  vtkBezierContourLineInterpolator adds nodes between idx1
  and idx2, that allow the contour to adhere to a bezier
  curve.
* obj.SetCostImage (vtkImageData ) - Set the image data for
  the vtkDijkstraImageGeodesicPath. If not set, the
  interpolator uses the image data input to the image actor.
  The image actor is obtained from the expected
  vtkImageActorPointPlacer.
* vtkImageData = obj.GetCostImage () - Set the image data
  for the vtkDijkstraImageGeodesicPath. If not set, the
  interpolator uses the image data input to the image actor.
  The image actor is obtained from the expected
  vtkImageActorPointPlacer.
* vtkDijkstraImageGeodesicPath =
  obj.GetDijkstraImageGeodesicPath () - access to the
  internal dijkstra path
