 Usage

Converts the two real input arguments into the real and
imaginary part (respectively) of a complex number. The
syntax for its use is

     y = complex(x,z)

where x and z are n-dimensional numerical arrays. The usual
rules for binary operators apply (i.e., one of the arguments
can be a scalar, if either is of type single the output is
single, etc.).
