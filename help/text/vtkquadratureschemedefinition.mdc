 Usage

An Elemental data type that holds a definition of a
numerical quadrature scheme. The definition contains the
requisite information to interpolate to the so called
quadrature points of the specific scheme. namely:

   1)
   A matrix of shape function weights(shape functions
  evaluated
   at parametric coordinates of the quadrature points).


   2)
   The number of quadrature points and cell nodes. These
  parameters
   size the matrix, and allow for convinent evaluation by
  users
   of the definition.

To create an instance of class
vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition, simply invoke its constructor
as follows

    obj = vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition



 Methods

The class vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition has several methods
that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o)
* int = obj.DeepCopy (vtkQuadratureSchemeDefinition other) -
  Deep copy.
* int = obj.SaveState (vtkXMLDataElement e) - Put the object
  into an XML representation. The element passed in is
  assumed to be empty.
* int = obj.RestoreState (vtkXMLDataElement e) - Restore the
  object from an XML representation.
* obj.Clear () - Release all allocated resources and set the
  object to an unitialized state.
* obj.Initialize (int cellType, int numberOfNodes, int
  numberOfQuadraturePoints, double shapeFunctionWeights) -
  Initialize the object allocating resources as needed.
* obj.Initialize (int cellType, int numberOfNodes, int
  numberOfQuadraturePoints, double shapeFunctionWeights,
  double quadratureWeights) - Initialize the object
  allocating resources as needed.
* int = obj.GetCellType () const - Access to an alternative
  key.
* int = obj.GetQuadratureKey () const - Get the number of
  nodes associated with the interpolation.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfNodes () const - Get the number of
  quadrature points associated with the scheme.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfQuadraturePoints () const - Get the
  array of shape function weights. Shape function weights
  are the shape functions evaluated at the quadrature
  points. There are "NumberOfNodes" weights for each
  quadrature point.
