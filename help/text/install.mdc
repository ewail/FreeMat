 Instructions

Here are the general instructions for installing FreeMat.
First, follow the instructions listed below for the platform
of interest. Then, run the

  -->pathtool

which brings up the path setup tool. More documentation on
the GUI elements (and how to use them) will be forthcoming.


 Linux

For Linux, FreeMat is now provided as a binary installation.
To install it simply download the binary using your web
browser, and then unpack it

    tar xvfz FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-Linux-Binary.tar.gz

You can then run FreeMat directly without any additional
effort

    FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-Linux-Binary/Contents/bin/
  FreeMat

will start up FreeMat as an X application. If you want to
run it as a command line application (to run from within an
xterm), use the nogui flag

    FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-Linux-Binary/Contents/bin/
  FreeMat -nogui

If you do not want FreeMat to use X at all (no graphics at
all), use the noX flag

    FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-Linux-Binary/Contents/bin/
  FreeMat -noX

For convenience, you may want to add FreeMat to your path.
The exact mechanism for doing this depends on your shell.
Assume that you have unpacked FreeMat-<VERSION_NUMBER>-
Linux-Binary.tar.gz into the directory /home/myname. Then if
you use csh or its derivatives (like tcsh) you should add
the following line to your .cshrc file:

    set path=($path /home/myname/FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-
  Linux/Binary/Contents/bin)

If you use bash, then add the following line to your
.bash_profile

    PATH=$PATH:/home/myname/FreeMat-\<VERSION_NUMBER\>-
  Linux/Binary/Contents/bin

If the prebuilt binary package does not work for your Linux
distribution, you will need to build FreeMat from source
(see the source section below). When you have FreeMat
running, you can setup your path using the pathtool. Note
that the FREEMAT_PATH is no longer used by FreeMat. You must
use the pathtool to adjust the path.


 Windows

For Windows, FreeMat is installed via a binary installer
program. To use it, simply download the setup program
FreeMat-<VERSION_NUMBER>-Setup.exe, and double click it.
Follow the instructions to do the installation, then setup
your path using pathtool.


 OS X

For Mac OS X, FreeMat is distributed as an application
bundle. To install it, simply download the compressed disk
image file FreeMat-<VERSION_NUMBER>.dmg, double click to
mount the disk image, and then copy the application FreeMat-
<VERSION_NUMBER> to some convenient place. To run FreeMat,
simply double click on the application. Run pathtool to
setup your FreeMat path.


 Code

The source code build is a little more complicated than
previous versions of FreeMat. Here are the current build
instructions for all platforms.

  1. Build and install Qt 4.3 or later - http://
     trolltech.com/developer/downloads/opensource
  2. Install g77 or gfortran (use fink for Mac OS X, use
     gcc-g77 package for MinGW)
  3. Download the source code FreeMat-<VERSION_NUMBER>-
     src.tar.gz.
  4. Unpack the source code: tar xvfz FreeMat-
     <VERSION_NUMBER>-src.tar.gz.
  5. For Windows, you will need to install MSYS as well as
     MINGW to build FreeMat. You will also need unzip to
     unpack the enclosed matio.zip archive. Alternately, you
     can cross-build the WIndows version of FreeMat under
     Linux (this is how I build it now).
  6. If you are extraordinarily lucky (or prepared), you can
     issue the usual ./configure, then the make and make
     install. This is not likely to work because of the
     somewhat esoteric dependencies of FreeMat. The
     configure step will probably fail and indicate what
     external dependencies are still needed.
  7. I assume that you are familiar with the process of
     installing dependencies if you are trying to build
     FreeMat from source.

To build a binary distributable (app bundle on the Mac,
setup installer on win32, and a binary distribution on
Linux), you will need to run make package instead of make
install.
