 Usage

The vtkSeedWidget is used to placed multiple seed points in
the scene. The seed points can be used for operations like
connectivity, segmentation, and region growing.
To use this widget, specify an instance of vtkSeedWidget and
a representation (a subclass of vtkSeedRepresentation). The
widget is implemented using multiple instances of
vtkHandleWidget which can be used to position the seed
points (after they are initially placed). The
representations for these handle widgets are provided by the
vtkSeedRepresentation.
.SECTION Event Bindings By default, the widget responds to
the following VTK events (i.e., it watches the
vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):

     LeftButtonPressEvent - add a point or select a handle
  (i.e., seed)
     RightButtonPressEvent - finish adding the seeds
     MouseMoveEvent - move a handle (i.e., seed)
     LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the selected handle
  (seed)

Note that the event bindings described above can be changed
using this class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class
translates VTK events into the vtkSeedWidget's widget
events:

     vtkWidgetEvent::AddPoint &ndash; add one point;
  depending on the state
                                 it may the first or second
  point added. Or,
                                 if near handle, select
  handle.
     vtkWidgetEvent::Completed &ndash; finished adding
  seeds.
     vtkWidgetEvent::Move &ndash; move the second point or
  handle depending on the state.
     vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect &ndash; the handle
  manipulation process has completed.

This widget invokes the following VTK events on itself
(which observers can listen for):

     vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (beginning to
  interact)
     vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (completing
  interaction)
     vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (moving after selecting
  something)
     vtkCommand::PlacePointEvent (after point is positioned;

                                  call data includes handle
  id (0,1))

To create an instance of class vtkSeedWidget, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSeedWidget



 Methods

The class vtkSeedWidget has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkSeedWidget class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard methods for a VTK
  class.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard methods for a VTK
  class.
* vtkSeedWidget = obj.NewInstance () - Standard methods for
  a VTK class.
* vtkSeedWidget = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o) - Standard
  methods for a VTK class.
* obj.SetEnabled (int ) - The method for activiating and
  deactiviating this widget. This method must be overridden
  because it is a composite widget and does more than its
  superclasses' vtkAbstractWidget::SetEnabled() method.
* obj.SetCurrentRenderer (vtkRenderer ) - Set the current
  renderer. This method also propagates to all the child
  handle widgets, if any exist
* obj.SetInteractor (vtkRenderWindowInteractor ) - Set the
  interactor. This method also propagates to all the child
  handle widgets, if any exist
* obj.SetRepresentation (vtkSeedRepresentation rep) - Create
  the default widget representation if one is not set.
* obj.CreateDefaultRepresentation () - Create the default
  widget representation if one is not set.
* obj.SetProcessEvents (int ) - Methods to change the
  whether the widget responds to interaction. Overridden to
  pass the state to component widgets.
* obj.CompleteInteraction () - Method to be called when the
  seed widget should stop responding to the place point
  interaction. The seed widget, when defined allows you
  place seeds by clicking on the render window. Use this
  method to indicate that you would like to stop placing
  seeds interactively. If you'd like the widget to stop
  responding to any user interaction simply disable event
  processing by the widget by calling widget-
  >ProcessEventsOff()
* obj.RestartInteraction () - Method to be called when the
  seed widget should start responding to the interaction.
* vtkHandleWidget = obj.CreateNewHandle () - Use this method
  to programmatically create a new handle. In interactive
  mode, (when the widget is in the PlacingSeeds state) this
  method is automatically invoked. The method returns the
  handle created. A valid seed representation must exist for
  the widget to create a new handle.
* obj.DeleteSeed (int n) - Delete the nth seed.
* vtkHandleWidget = obj.GetSeed (int n) - Get the nth seed
