 Methods

The class vtkLookupTableWithEnabling has several methods
that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkLookupTableWithEnabling class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkLookupTableWithEnabling = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkLookupTableWithEnabling = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject
  o)
* vtkDataArray = obj.GetEnabledArray () - This must be set
  before MapScalars() is called. Indices of this array must
  map directly to those in the scalars array passed to
  MapScalars(). Values of 0 in the array indicate the color
  should be desaturatated.
* obj.SetEnabledArray (vtkDataArray enabledArray) - This
  must be set before MapScalars() is called. Indices of this
  array must map directly to those in the scalars array
  passed to MapScalars(). Values of 0 in the array indicate
  the color should be desaturatated.
* obj.DisableColor (char r, char g, char b, string rd,
  string gd, string bd) - A convenience method for taking a
  color and desaturating it.
