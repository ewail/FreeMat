 Usage

Computes the asin function for its argument. The general
syntax for its use is

    y = asin(x)

where x is an n-dimensional array of numerical type. Integer
types are promoted to the double type prior to calculation
of the asin function. Output y is of the same size and type
as the input x, (unless x is an integer, in which case y is
a double type).


 Internals

Mathematically, the asin function is defined for all
arguments x as
 \[ \mathrm{asin} x \equiv - i \log \left(i x + \sqrt{1-
x^2}\right). \]
For real valued variables x in the range [-1,1], the
function is computed directly using the standard C library's
numerical asin function. For both real and complex arguments
x, note that generally
 \[ \mathrm{asin}(\sin(x)) \neq x, \]
due to the periodicity of sin(x).


 Example

The following code demonstates the asin function over the
range [-1,1].

  --> t = linspace(-1,1);
  --> plot(t,asin(t))
