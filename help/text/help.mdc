 Usage

Displays help on a function available in FreeMat. The help
function takes one argument:

    help topic

where topic is the topic to look for help on. For scripts,
the result of running help is the contents of the comments
at the top of the file. If FreeMat finds no comments, then
it simply displays the function declaration.
