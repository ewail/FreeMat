 Usage

This routine simulates keystrokes from the user on FreeMat.
The general syntax for its use is

     otext = simkeys(text)

where text is a string to simulate as input to the console.
The output of the commands are captured and returned in the
string otext. This is primarily used by the testing
infrastructure.
