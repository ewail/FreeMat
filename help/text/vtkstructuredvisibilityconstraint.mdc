 Usage

vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint is a general class to
manage a list of points/cell marked as invalid or invisible.
Currently, it does this by maintaining an unsigned char
array associated with points/cells. To conserve memory, this
array is allocated only when it is needed (when Blank() is
called the first time). Make sure to call Initialize() with
the right dimensions before calling any methods that set/get
visibility.
To create an instance of class
vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint



 Methods

The class vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint has several
methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that
the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o)
* char = obj.IsVisible (vtkIdType id) - Returns 1 is the
  point/cell is visible, 0 otherwise.
* obj.Blank (vtkIdType id) - Sets the visibility flag of the
  given point/cell off. The first time blank is called, a
  new visibility array is created if it doesn't exist.
* obj.UnBlank (vtkIdType id) - Sets the visibility flag of
  the given point/cell on.
* int = obj. GetDimensions () - Get the dimensions used to
  initialize the object.
* obj.Initialize (int dims[3]) - Set the dimensions and set
  the Initialized flag to 1. Once an object is initialized,
  it's dimensions can not be changed anymore.
* obj.SetVisibilityById (vtkUnsignedCharArray vis) - Set/Get
  the array used to store the visibility flags.
* vtkUnsignedCharArray = obj.GetVisibilityById () - Set/Get
  the array used to store the visibility flags.
* obj.ShallowCopy (vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint src) -
  Copies the dimensions, the visibility array pointer and
  the initialized flag.
* obj.DeepCopy (vtkStructuredVisibilityConstraint src) -
  Copies the dimensions, the visibility array and the
  initialized flag.
* char = obj.IsConstrained ()
