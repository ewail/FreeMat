 Usage

Divides two numerical arrays (elementwise). There are two
forms for its use, both with the same general syntax:

    y = a ./ b

where a and b are n-dimensional arrays of numerical type. In
the first case, the two arguments are the same size, in
which case, the output y is the same size as the inputs, and
is the element-wise division of b by a. In the second case,
either a or b is a scalar, in which case y is the same size
as the larger argument, and is the division of the scalar
with each element of the other argument.
The rules for manipulating types has changed in FreeMat 4.0.
See typerules for more details.


 Internals

There are three formulae for the dot-right-divide operator,
depending on the sizes of the three arguments. In the most
general case, in which the two arguments are the same size,
the output is computed via:
 \[ y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{b
(m_1,\ldots,m_d)} \]
If a is a scalar, then the output is computed via
 \[ y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{a}{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)} \]
On the other hand, if b is a scalar, then the output is
computed via
 \[ y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{b}. \]


 Examples

Here are some examples of using the dot-right-divide
operator. First, a straight-forward usage of the ./
operator. The first example is straightforward:

  --> 3 ./ 8

  ans =
      0.3750

We can also divide complex arguments:

  --> a = 3 + 4*i

  a =
     3.0000 +  4.0000i

  --> b = 5 + 8*i

  b =
     5.0000 +  8.0000i

  --> c = a ./ b

  c =
     0.5281 -  0.0449i

We can also demonstrate the three forms of the dot-right-
divide operator. First the element-wise version:

  --> a = [1,2;3,4]

  a =
   1 2
   3 4

  --> b = [2,3;6,7]

  b =
   2 3
   6 7

  --> c = a ./ b

  c =
      0.5000    0.6667
      0.5000    0.5714

Then the scalar versions

  --> c = a ./ 3

  c =
      0.3333    0.6667
      1.0000    1.3333

  --> c = 3 ./ a

  c =
      3.0000    1.5000
      1.0000    0.7500
