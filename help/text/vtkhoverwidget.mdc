 Usage

The vtkHoverWidget is used to invoke an event when hovering
in a render window. Hovering occurs when mouse motion (in
the render window) does not occur for a specified amount of
time (i.e., TimerDuration). This class can be used as is (by
observing TimerEvents) or for class derivation for those
classes wishing to do more with the hover event.
To use this widget, specify an instance of vtkHoverWidget
and specify the time (in milliseconds) defining the hover
period. Unlike most widgets, this widget does not require a
representation (although subclasses like vtkBalloonWidget do
require a representation).
.SECTION Event Bindings By default, the widget observes the
following VTK events (i.e., it watches the
vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):

     MouseMoveEvent - manages a timer used to determine
  whether the mouse
                      is hovering.
     TimerEvent - when the time between events (e.g., mouse
  move), then a
                  timer event is invoked.
     KeyPressEvent - when the "Enter" key is pressed after
  the balloon appears,
                     a callback is activited (e.g.,
  WidgetActivateEvent).

Note that the event bindings described above can be changed
using this class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class
translates VTK events into the vtkHoverWidget's widget
events:

     vtkWidgetEvent::Move &ndash; start (or reset) the timer
     vtkWidgetEvent::TimedOut &ndash; when enough time is
  elapsed between defined
                                 VTK events the hover event
  is invoked.
     vtkWidgetEvent::SelectAction &ndash; activate any
  callbacks associated
                                     with the balloon.

This widget invokes the following VTK events on itself when
the widget determines that it is hovering. Note that
observers of this widget can listen for these events and
take appropriate action.

     vtkCommand::TimerEvent (when hovering is determined to
  occur)
     vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (after a hover has
  occured and the
                                      mouse begins moving
  again).
     vtkCommand::WidgetActivateEvent (when the balloon is
  selected with a
                                      keypress).

To create an instance of class vtkHoverWidget, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkHoverWidget



 Methods

The class vtkHoverWidget has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkHoverWidget class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard methods for a VTK
  class.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard methods for a VTK
  class.
* vtkHoverWidget = obj.NewInstance () - Standard methods for
  a VTK class.
* vtkHoverWidget = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o) - Standard
  methods for a VTK class.
* obj.SetTimerDuration (int ) - Specify the hovering
  interval (in milliseconds). If after moving the mouse the
  pointer stays over a vtkProp for this duration, then a
  vtkTimerEvent::TimerEvent is invoked.
* int = obj.GetTimerDurationMinValue () - Specify the
  hovering interval (in milliseconds). If after moving the
  mouse the pointer stays over a vtkProp for this duration,
  then a vtkTimerEvent::TimerEvent is invoked.
* int = obj.GetTimerDurationMaxValue () - Specify the
  hovering interval (in milliseconds). If after moving the
  mouse the pointer stays over a vtkProp for this duration,
  then a vtkTimerEvent::TimerEvent is invoked.
* int = obj.GetTimerDuration () - Specify the hovering
  interval (in milliseconds). If after moving the mouse the
  pointer stays over a vtkProp for this duration, then a
  vtkTimerEvent::TimerEvent is invoked.
* obj.SetEnabled (int ) - The method for activiating and
  deactiviating this widget. This method must be overridden
  because it performs special timer-related operations.
* obj.CreateDefaultRepresentation ()
