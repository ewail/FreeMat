 Usage

vtkSuperquadric computes the implicit function and function
gradient for a superquadric. vtkSuperquadric is a concrete
implementation of vtkImplicitFunction. The superquadric is
centered at Center and axes of rotation is along the y-axis.
(Use the superclass' vtkImplicitFunction transformation
matrix if necessary to reposition.) Roundness parameters
(PhiRoundness and ThetaRoundness) control the shape of the
superquadric. The Toroidal boolean controls whether a
toroidal superquadric is produced. If so, the Thickness
parameter controls the thickness of the toroid: 0 is the
thinnest allowable toroid, and 1 has a minimum sized hole.
The Scale parameters allow the superquadric to be scaled in
x, y, and z (normal vectors are correctly generated in any
case). The Size parameter controls size of the superquadric.
This code is based on "Rigid physically based
superquadrics", A. H. Barr, in "Graphics Gems III", David
Kirk, ed., Academic Press, 1992.
To create an instance of class vtkSuperquadric, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSuperquadric



 Methods

The class vtkSuperquadric has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkSuperquadric class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSuperquadric = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSuperquadric = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x[3])
* double = obj.EvaluateFunction (double x, double y, double
  z)
* obj.EvaluateGradient (double x[3], double g[3])
* obj.SetCenter (double , double , double ) - Set the center
  of the superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* obj.SetCenter (double a[3]) - Set the center of the
  superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* double = obj. GetCenter () - Set the center of the
  superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* obj.SetScale (double , double , double ) - Set the scale
  factors of the superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* obj.SetScale (double a[3]) - Set the scale factors of the
  superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* double = obj. GetScale () - Set the scale factors of the
  superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* double = obj.GetThickness () - Set/Get Superquadric ring
  thickness (toroids only). Changing thickness maintains the
  outside diameter of the toroid.
* obj.SetThickness (double ) - Set/Get Superquadric ring
  thickness (toroids only). Changing thickness maintains the
  outside diameter of the toroid.
* double = obj.GetThicknessMinValue () - Set/Get
  Superquadric ring thickness (toroids only). Changing
  thickness maintains the outside diameter of the toroid.
* double = obj.GetThicknessMaxValue () - Set/Get
  Superquadric ring thickness (toroids only). Changing
  thickness maintains the outside diameter of the toroid.
* double = obj.GetPhiRoundness () - Set/Get Superquadric
  north/south roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular)
  to 1 (circular) to higher orders.
* obj.SetPhiRoundness (double e) - Set/Get Superquadric
  north/south roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular)
  to 1 (circular) to higher orders.
* double = obj.GetThetaRoundness () - Set/Get Superquadric
  east/west roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular) to
  1 (circular) to higher orders.
* obj.SetThetaRoundness (double e) - Set/Get Superquadric
  east/west roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular) to
  1 (circular) to higher orders.
* obj.SetSize (double ) - Set/Get Superquadric isotropic
  size.
* double = obj.GetSize () - Set/Get Superquadric isotropic
  size.
* obj.ToroidalOn () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0).
* obj.ToroidalOff () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0).
* int = obj.GetToroidal () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0).
* obj.SetToroidal (int ) - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0).
