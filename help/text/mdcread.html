 Usage

Given a filename, reads an HTML document, (attempts to)
parse it, and returns the result as a FreeMat data
structure. The syntax for its use is:

     p = htmlread(filename)

where filename is a string. The resulting object p is a data
structure containing the information in the document. Note
that this function works by internally converting the HTML
document into something closer to XHTML, and then using the
XML parser to parse it. In some cases, the converted HTML
cannot be properly parsed. In such cases, a third party tool
such as "tidy" will probably do a better job.
