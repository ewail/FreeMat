 Usage

To create an instance of class vtkSelection, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSelection



 Methods

The class vtkSelection has several methods that can be used.
They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkSelection class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSelection = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSelection = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.Initialize () - Restore data object to initial state,
* int = obj.GetDataObjectType () - Returns the number of
  nodes in this selection. Each node contains information
  about part of the selection.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfNodes () - Returns the number of
  nodes in this selection. Each node contains information
  about part of the selection.
* vtkSelectionNode = obj.GetNode (int idx) - Returns a node
  given it's index. Performs bound checking and will return
  0 if out-of-bounds.
* obj.AddNode (vtkSelectionNode ) - Adds a selection node.
* obj.RemoveNode (int idx) - Removes a selection node.
* obj.RemoveNode (vtkSelectionNode ) - Removes a selection
  node.
* obj.RemoveAllNodes () - Removes a selection node.
* obj.DeepCopy (vtkDataObject src) - Copy selection nodes of
  the input.
* obj.ShallowCopy (vtkDataObject src) - Copy selection nodes
  of the input. This is a shallow copy: selection lists and
  pointers in the properties are passed by reference.
* obj.Union (vtkSelection selection) - Union this selection
  with the specified selection. Attempts to reuse selection
  nodes in this selection if properties match exactly.
  Otherwise, creates new selection nodes.
* obj.Union (vtkSelectionNode node) - Union this selection
  with the specified selection node. Attempts to reuse a
  selection node in this selection if properties match
  exactly. Otherwise, creates a new selection node.
* long = obj.GetMTime () - Return the MTime taking into
  account changes to the properties
* obj.Dump () - Dumps the contents of the selection, giving
  basic information only.
