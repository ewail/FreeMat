 Usage

Converts the argument to an signed 8-bit Integer. The syntax
for its use is

     y = int8(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array. Conversion
follows the saturation rules (e.g., if x is outside the
normal range for a signed 8-bit integer of [-127,127], it is
truncated to that range. Note that both NaN and Inf both map
to 0.


 Example

The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of
int8. First, the routine uses

  --> int8(100)

  ans =
   100

  --> int8(-100)

  ans =
   -100

In the next example, an integer outside the range of the
type is passed in. The result is truncated to the range of
the type.

  --> int8(400)

  ans =
   127

In the next example, a positive double precision argument is
passed in. The result is the signed integer that is closest
to the argument.

  --> int8(pi)

  ans =
   3

In the next example, a complex argument is passed in. The
result is the signed complex integer that is closest to the
argument.

  --> int8(5+2*i)

  ans =
     5.0000 +  2.0000i

In the next example, a string argument is passed in. The
string argument is converted into an integer array
corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.

  --> int8('helo')

  ans =
   104 101 108 111

In the last example, a cell-array is passed in. For cell-
arrays and structure arrays, the result is an error.

  --> int8({4})
