 Usage

The ctypeprint function prints a C type on the console. The
usage is

    ctypeprint(typename)

where typename is a string containing the name of the C type
to print. Depending on the class of the C type (e.g.,
structure, alias or enumeration) the ctypeprint function
will dump information about the type definition.
