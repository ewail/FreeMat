 Usage

A reader for a data format used by Omega3p, Tau3p, and
several other tools used at the Standford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC). The underlying format uses netCDF to store
arrays, but also imposes several conventions to form an
unstructured grid of elements.
To create an instance of class vtkSLACReader, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSLACReader



 Methods

The class vtkSLACReader has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkSLACReader class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSLACReader = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSLACReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* string = obj.GetMeshFileName ()
* obj.SetMeshFileName (string )
* obj.AddModeFileName (string fname) - There may be one mode
  file (usually for actual modes) or multiple mode files
  (which usually actually represent time series). These
  methods set and clear the list of mode files (which can be
  a single mode file).
* obj.RemoveAllModeFileNames () - There may be one mode file
  (usually for actual modes) or multiple mode files (which
  usually actually represent time series). These methods set
  and clear the list of mode files (which can be a single
  mode file).
* int = obj.GetNumberOfModeFileNames () - There may be one
  mode file (usually for actual modes) or multiple mode
  files (which usually actually represent time series).
  These methods set and clear the list of mode files (which
  can be a single mode file).
* string = obj.GetModeFileName (int idx) - There may be one
  mode file (usually for actual modes) or multiple mode
  files (which usually actually represent time series).
  These methods set and clear the list of mode files (which
  can be a single mode file).
* int = obj.GetReadInternalVolume () - If on, reads the
  internal volume of the data set. Set to off by default.
* obj.SetReadInternalVolume (int ) - If on, reads the
  internal volume of the data set. Set to off by default.
* obj.ReadInternalVolumeOn () - If on, reads the internal
  volume of the data set. Set to off by default.
* obj.ReadInternalVolumeOff () - If on, reads the internal
  volume of the data set. Set to off by default.
* int = obj.GetReadExternalSurface () - If on, reads the
  external surfaces of the data set. Set to on by default.
* obj.SetReadExternalSurface (int ) - If on, reads the
  external surfaces of the data set. Set to on by default.
* obj.ReadExternalSurfaceOn () - If on, reads the external
  surfaces of the data set. Set to on by default.
* obj.ReadExternalSurfaceOff () - If on, reads the external
  surfaces of the data set. Set to on by default.
* int = obj.GetReadMidpoints () - If on, reads midpoint
  information for external surfaces and builds quadratic
  surface triangles. Set to on by default.
* obj.SetReadMidpoints (int ) - If on, reads midpoint
  information for external surfaces and builds quadratic
  surface triangles. Set to on by default.
* obj.ReadMidpointsOn () - If on, reads midpoint information
  for external surfaces and builds quadratic surface
  triangles. Set to on by default.
* obj.ReadMidpointsOff () - If on, reads midpoint
  information for external surfaces and builds quadratic
  surface triangles. Set to on by default.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfVariableArrays () - Variable array
  selection.
* string = obj.GetVariableArrayName (int idx) - Variable
  array selection.
* int = obj.GetVariableArrayStatus (string name) - Variable
  array selection.
* obj.SetVariableArrayStatus (string name, int status) -
  Variable array selection.
