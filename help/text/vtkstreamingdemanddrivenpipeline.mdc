 Usage

vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline is an executive that
supports updating only a portion of the data set in the
pipeline. This is the style of pipeline update that is
provided by the old-style VTK 4.x pipeline. Instead of
always updating an entire data set, this executive supports
asking for pieces or sub-extents.
To create an instance of class
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline



 Methods

The class vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline has several
methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that
the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o)
* int = obj.Update () - Bring the outputs up-to-date.
* int = obj.Update (int port) - Bring the outputs up-to-
  date.
* int = obj.UpdateWholeExtent () - Bring the outputs up-to-
  date.
* int = obj.PropagateUpdateExtent (int outputPort) -
  Propagate the update request from the given output port
  back through the pipeline. Should be called only when
  information is up to date.
* int = obj.SetMaximumNumberOfPieces (int port, int n) -
  Set/Get the maximum number of pieces that can be requested
  from the given port. The maximum number of pieces is meta
  data for unstructured data sets. It gets set by the source
  during the update information call. A value of -
  1 indicates that there is no maximum.

  n) - Set/Get the maximum number of pieces that can be
  requested from the given port. The maximum number of
  pieces is meta data for unstructured data sets. It gets
  set by the source during the update information call. A
  value of -1 indicates that there is no maximum.
* int = obj.GetMaximumNumberOfPieces (int port) - Set/Get
  the maximum number of pieces that can be requested from
  the given port. The maximum number of pieces is meta data

  1 indicates that there is no maximum.
* int = obj.GetMaximumNumberOfPieces (vtkInformation ) -
  Set/Get the maximum number of pieces that can be requested
