 Usage

Computes the log10 function for its argument. The general
syntax for its use is

    y = log10(x)

where x is an n-dimensional array of numerical type. Integer
types are promoted to the double type prior to calculation
of the log10 function. Output y is of the same size as the
input x. For strictly positive, real inputs, the output type
is the same as the input. For negative and complex
arguments, the output is complex.


 Example

The following piece of code plots the real-valued log10
function over the interval [1,100]:

  --> x = linspace(1,100);
  --> plot(x,log10(x))
  --> xlabel('x');
  --> ylabel('log10(x)');
