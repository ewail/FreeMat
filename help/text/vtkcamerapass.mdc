 Usage

Render the camera.
It setups the projection and modelview matrices and can
clear the background It calls its delegate once. After its
delegate returns, it restore the modelview matrix stack.
Its delegate is usually set to a vtkSequencePass with a
vtkLigthsPass and a list of passes for the geometry.
To create an instance of class vtkCameraPass, simply invoke
its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkCameraPass



 Methods

The class vtkCameraPass has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkCameraPass class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkCameraPass = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkCameraPass = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow w) - Release
  graphics resources and ask components to release their own
  resources.


    Precondition:
        w_exists: w!=0

* vtkRenderPass = obj.GetDelegatePass () - Delegate for
  rendering the geometry. If it is NULL, nothing will be
  rendered and a warning will be emitted. It is usually set
  to a vtkSequencePass with a vtkLigthsPass and a list of
  passes for the geometry. Initial value is a NULL pointer.
* obj.SetDelegatePass (vtkRenderPass delegatePass) -
  Delegate for rendering the geometry. If it is NULL,
  nothing will be rendered and a warning will be emitted. It
  is usually set to a vtkSequencePass with a vtkLigthsPass
  and a list of passes for the geometry. Initial value is a
  NULL pointer.
