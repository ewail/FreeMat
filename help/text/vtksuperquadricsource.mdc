 Usage

vtkSuperquadricSource creates a superquadric (represented by
polygons) of specified size centered at the origin. The
resolution (polygonal discretization) in both the latitude
(phi) and longitude (theta) directions can be specified.
Roundness parameters (PhiRoundness and ThetaRoundness)
control the shape of the superquadric. The Toroidal boolean
controls whether a toroidal superquadric is produced. If so,
the Thickness parameter controls the thickness of the
toroid: 0 is the thinnest allowable toroid, and 1 has a
minimum sized hole. The Scale parameters allow the
superquadric to be scaled in x, y, and z (normal vectors are
correctly generated in any case). The Size parameter
controls size of the superquadric.
This code is based on "Rigid physically based
superquadrics", A. H. Barr, in "Graphics Gems III", David
Kirk, ed., Academic Press, 1992.
To create an instance of class vtkSuperquadricSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkSuperquadricSource



 Methods

The class vtkSuperquadricSource has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkSuperquadricSource class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkSuperquadricSource = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkSuperquadricSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetCenter (double , double , double ) - Set the center
  of the superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* obj.SetCenter (double a[3]) - Set the center of the
  superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* double = obj. GetCenter () - Set the center of the
  superquadric. Default is 0,0,0.
* obj.SetScale (double , double , double ) - Set the scale
  factors of the superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* obj.SetScale (double a[3]) - Set the scale factors of the
  superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* double = obj. GetScale () - Set the scale factors of the
  superquadric. Default is 1,1,1.
* int = obj.GetThetaResolution () - Set the number of points
  in the longitude direction. Initial value is 16.
* obj.SetThetaResolution (int i) - Set the number of points
  in the longitude direction. Initial value is 16.
* int = obj.GetPhiResolution () - Set the number of points
  in the latitude direction. Initial value is 16.
* obj.SetPhiResolution (int i) - Set the number of points in
  the latitude direction. Initial value is 16.
* double = obj.GetThickness () - Set/Get Superquadric ring
  thickness (toroids only). Changing thickness maintains the
  outside diameter of the toroid. Initial value is 0.3333.
* obj.SetThickness (double ) - Set/Get Superquadric ring
  thickness (toroids only). Changing thickness maintains the
  outside diameter of the toroid. Initial value is 0.3333.
* double = obj.GetThicknessMinValue () - Set/Get
  Superquadric ring thickness (toroids only). Changing
  thickness maintains the outside diameter of the toroid.
  Initial value is 0.3333.
* double = obj.GetThicknessMaxValue () - Set/Get
  Superquadric ring thickness (toroids only). Changing
  thickness maintains the outside diameter of the toroid.
  Initial value is 0.3333.
* double = obj.GetPhiRoundness () - Set/Get Superquadric
  north/south roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular)
  to 1 (circular) to higher orders. Initial value is 1.0.
* obj.SetPhiRoundness (double e) - Set/Get Superquadric
  north/south roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular)
  to 1 (circular) to higher orders. Initial value is 1.0.
* double = obj.GetThetaRoundness () - Set/Get Superquadric
  east/west roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular) to
  1 (circular) to higher orders. Initial value is 1.0.
* obj.SetThetaRoundness (double e) - Set/Get Superquadric
  east/west roundness. Values range from 0 (rectangular) to
  1 (circular) to higher orders. Initial value is 1.0.
* obj.SetSize (double ) - Set/Get Superquadric isotropic
  size. Initial value is 0.5;
* double = obj.GetSize () - Set/Get Superquadric isotropic
  size. Initial value is 0.5;
* obj.ToroidalOn () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0). Initial
  value is 0.
* obj.ToroidalOff () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0). Initial
  value is 0.
* int = obj.GetToroidal () - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0). Initial
  value is 0.
* obj.SetToroidal (int ) - Set/Get whether or not the
  superquadric is toroidal (1) or ellipsoidal (0). Initial
  value is 0.
