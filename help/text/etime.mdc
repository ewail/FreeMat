 Usage

The etime calculates the elapsed time between two clock
vectors x1 and x2. The syntax for its use is

     y = etime(x1,x2)

where x1 and x2 are in the clock output format

     x = [year month day hour minute seconds]



 Example

Here we use etime as a substitute for tic and toc

  --> x1 = clock;
  --> sleep(1);
  --> x2 = clock;
  --> etime(x2,x1);
