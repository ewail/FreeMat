 Usage

There are several ways to use ylim to adjust the Y axis
limits of a plot. The various syntaxes are

     ylim
     ylim([lo,hi])
     ylim('auto')
     ylim('manual')
     ylim('mode')
     ylim(handle,...)

The first form (without arguments), returns a 2-vector
containing the current limits. The second form sets the
limits on the plot to [lo,hi]. The third and fourth form set
the mode for the limit to auto and manual respectively. In
auto mode, FreeMat chooses the range for the axis
automatically. The ylim('mode') form returns the current
mode for the axis (either 'auto' or 'manual'). Finally, you
can specify the handle of an axis to manipulate instead of
using the current one.
As an additional feature, you can now specify inf for a
limit, and FreeMat will take that limit from the automatic
set. So, for example ylim([10,inf]) will set the minimum for
the y axis, but use the automatic value for the maximum.


 Example


  --> x = linspace(-1,1);
  --> y = sin(2*pi*x);
  --> plot(x,y,'r-');
  --> ylim  % what are the current limits?

  ans =
     -0.9999    0.9999

which results in

Next, we zoom in on the plot using the ylim function

  --> plot(x,y,'r-')
  --> ylim([-0.2,0.2])

which results in
 ylim2.png
To demonstrate the infinite limits feature. Consider the
following

  --> plot(x,y,'r-');
  --> ylim([0,inf])

which results in
 ylim3.png
