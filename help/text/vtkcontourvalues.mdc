 Usage

vtkContourValues is a general class to manage the creation,
generation, and retrieval of contour values. This class
serves as a helper class for contouring classes, or those
classes operating on lists of contour values.
To create an instance of class vtkContourValues, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkContourValues



 Methods

The class vtkContourValues has several methods that can be
used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is
translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not
be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK
website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance of
the vtkContourValues class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkContourValues = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkContourValues = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetValue (int i, double value) - Set the ith contour
  value.
* double = obj.GetValue (int i) - Get the ith contour value.
  The return value will be clamped if the index i is out of
  range.
* obj.GetValues (double contourValues) - Fill a supplied
  list with contour values. Make sure you've allocated
  memory of size GetNumberOfContours().
* obj.SetNumberOfContours (int number) - Set the number of
  contours to place into the list. You only really need to
  use this method to reduce list size. The method SetValue()
  will automatically increase list size as needed.
* int = obj.GetNumberOfContours () - Return the number of
  contours in the
* obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double range[2]) -
  Generate numContours equally spaced contour values between
  specified range. Contour values will include min/max range
  values.
* obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double rangeStart,
  double rangeEnd) - Generate numContours equally spaced
  contour values between specified range. Contour values
  will include min/max range values.
