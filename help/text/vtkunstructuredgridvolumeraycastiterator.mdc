 Usage

vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator is a superclass for
iterating over the intersections of a viewing ray with a
group of unstructured cells. These iterators are created
with a vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastFunction.
To create an instance of class
vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator



 Methods

The class vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator has
several methods that can be used. They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from
the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible.
When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods
listed below, obj is an instance of the
vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator = obj.NewInstance
  ()
* vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeRayCastIterator =
  obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.Initialize (int x, int y) - Initializes the iteration
  to the start of the ray at the given screen coordinates.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetNextIntersections (vtkIdList
  intersectedCells, vtkDoubleArray intersectionLengths,
  vtkDataArray scalars, vtkDataArray nearIntersections,
  vtkDataArray farIntersections) - Get the intersections of
  the next several cells. The cell ids are stored in
  intersectedCells and the length of each ray segment within
  the cell is stored in intersectionLengths. The point
  scalars scalars are interpolated and stored in
  nearIntersections and farIntersections. intersectedCells,
  intersectionLengths, or scalars may be NULL to supress
  passing the associated information. The number of
  intersections actually encountered is returned. 0 is
  returned if and only if no more intersections are to be
  found.
* obj.SetBounds (double , double ) - Set/get the bounds of
  the cast ray (in viewing coordinates). By default the
  range is [0,1].
* obj.SetBounds (double a[2]) - Set/get the bounds of the
  cast ray (in viewing coordinates). By default the range is
  [0,1].
* double = obj. GetBounds () - Set/get the bounds of the
  cast ray (in viewing coordinates). By default the range is
  [0,1].
* obj.SetMaxNumberOfIntersections (vtkIdType )
* vtkIdType = obj.GetMaxNumberOfIntersections ()
