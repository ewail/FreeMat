 Usage

Converts the argument array into a string. The syntax for
its use is

     y = string(x)

where x is an n-dimensional numerical array.


 Example

Here we take an array containing ASCII codes for a string,
and convert it into a string.

  --> a = [104,101,108,108,111]

  a =
   104 101 108 108 111

  --> string(a)

  ans =
  hello
