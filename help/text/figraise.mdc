 Usage

Raises a figure window indicated by the figure number. The
syntax for its use is

    figraise(fignum)

where fignum is the number of the figure to raise. The
figure will be raised to the top of the GUI stack (meaning
that it we be visible). Note that this function does not
cause fignum to become the current figure, you must use the
figure command for that.
