 Usage

FreeMat functions can return a variable number of output
arguments by setting the last argument in the argument list
to varargout. This special keyword indicates that the number
of return values is variable. The general syntax for a
function that returns a variable number of outputs is

    function [out_1,...,out_M,varargout] = fname
  (in_1,...,in_M)

The function is responsible for ensuring that varargout is a
cell array that contains the values to assign to the outputs
beyond out_M. Generally, variable output functions use
nargout to figure out how many outputs have been requested.


 Example

This is a function that returns a varying number of values
depending on the value of the argument.

       varoutfunc.m


  function [varargout] = varoutfunc
    switch(nargout)
      case 1
        varargout = {'one of one'};
      case 2
        varargout = {'one of two','two of two'};
      case 3
        varargout = {'one of three','two of three','three of
  three'};
    end

Here are some examples of exercising varoutfunc:

  --> [c1] = varoutfunc
  c1 =
  one of one
  --> [c1,c2] = varoutfunc
  c1 =
  one of two
  c2 =
  two of two
  --> [c1,c2,c3] = varoutfunc
  c1 =
  one of three
  c2 =
  two of three
  c3 =
  three of three
