 Usage

vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter is a filter that allows you to
place a glyph at each input point in the dataset. In
addition, the filter is programmable which means the user
has control over the generation of the glyph. The glyphs can
be controlled via the point data attributes (e.g., scalars,
vectors, etc.) or any other information in the input
dataset.
This is the way the filter works. You must define an input
dataset which at a minimum contains points with associated
attribute values. Also, the Source instance variable must be
set which is of type vtkPolyData. Then, for each point in
the input, the PointId is set to the current point id, and a
user-defined function is called (i.e., GlyphMethod). In this
method you can manipulate the Source data (including
changing to a different Source object). After the
GlyphMethod is called, vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter will
invoke an Update() on its Source object, and then copy its
data to the output of the vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter.
Therefore the output of this filter is of type vtkPolyData.
Another option to this filter is the way you color the
glyphs. You can use the scalar data from the input or the
source. The instance variable ColorMode controls this
behavior.
To create an instance of class vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter,
simply invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter



 Methods

The class vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter has several methods
that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the
documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject
  o)
* obj.SetSource (vtkPolyData source) - Set/Get the source to
  use for this glyph. Note: you can change the source during
  execution of this filter.
* vtkPolyData = obj.GetSource () - Set/Get the source to use
  for this glyph. Note: you can change the source during
  execution of this filter.
* vtkIdType = obj.GetPointId () - Get the current point id
  during processing. Value only valid during the Execute()
  method of this filter. (Meant to be called by the
  GlyphMethod().)
* double = obj. GetPoint () - Get the current point
  coordinates during processing. Value only valid during the
  Execute() method of this filter. (Meant to be called by
  the GlyphMethod().)
* vtkPointData = obj.GetPointData () - Get the set of point
  data attributes for the input. A convenience to the
  programmer to be used in the GlyphMethod(). Only valid
  during the Execute() method of this filter.
* obj.SetColorMode (int ) - Either color by the input or
  source scalar data.
* int = obj.GetColorMode () - Either color by the input or
  source scalar data.
* obj.SetColorModeToColorByInput () - Either color by the
  input or source scalar data.
* obj.SetColorModeToColorBySource () - Either color by the
  input or source scalar data.
* string = obj.GetColorModeAsString () - Either color by the
  input or source scalar data.
