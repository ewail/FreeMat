 Usage

vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator is an abstract base class
for contour line interpolators that interpolate on polygonal
data.
To create an instance of class
vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator, simply invoke its
constructor as follows

    obj = vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator



 Methods

The class vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator has several
methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that
the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK
sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in
doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below,
obj is an instance of the vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator
class.

* string = obj.GetClassName () - Standard methods for
  instances of this class.
* int = obj.IsA (string name) - Standard methods for
  instances of this class.
* vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator = obj.NewInstance () -
  Standard methods for instances of this class.
* vtkPolyDataContourLineInterpolator = obj.SafeDownCast
  (vtkObject o) - Standard methods for instances of this
  class.
* int = obj.InterpolateLine (vtkRenderer ren,
  vtkContourRepresentation rep, int idx1, int idx2) -
  Subclasses that wish to interpolate a line segment must
  implement this. For instance
  vtkBezierContourLineInterpolator adds nodes between idx1
  and idx2, that allow the contour to adhere to a bezier
  curve.
* int = obj.UpdateNode (vtkRenderer ,
  vtkContourRepresentation , double , int ) - The
  interpolator is given a chance to update the node.
  vtkImageContourLineInterpolator updates the idx'th node in
  the contour, so it automatically sticks to edges in the
  vicinity as the user constructs the contour. Returns 0 if
  the node (world position) is unchanged.
* vtkPolyDataCollection = obj.GetPolys () - Be sure to add
  polydata on which you wish to place points to this list or
  they will not be considered for placement.
