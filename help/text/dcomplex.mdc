 Usage

The dcomplex function used to convert variables into 64-bit
complex data types in prior versions of FreeMat. Starting
with FreeMat 4, the type rules are the same as Matlab,
hence, there is no distinction between a 64-bit complex type
and and 64-bit real type. Thus, the dcomplex function is
just a synonym for double.
