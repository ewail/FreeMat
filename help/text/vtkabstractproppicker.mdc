 Usage

vtkAbstractPropPicker is an abstract superclass for pickers
that can pick an instance of vtkProp. Some pickers, like
vtkWorldPointPicker (not a subclass of this class), cannot
identify the prop that is picked. Subclasses of
vtkAbstractPropPicker return a prop in the form of a
vtkAssemblyPath when a pick is invoked. Note that an
vtkAssemblyPath contain a list of vtkAssemblyNodes, each of
which in turn contains a reference to a vtkProp and a 4x4
transformation matrix. The path fully describes the entire
pick path, so you can pick assemblies or portions of
assemblies, or just grab the tail end of the vtkAssemblyPath
(which is the picked prop).
To create an instance of class vtkAbstractPropPicker, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

    obj = vtkAbstractPropPicker



 Methods

The class vtkAbstractPropPicker has several methods that can
be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation
is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may
not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the
VTK website. In the methods listed below, obj is an instance
of the vtkAbstractPropPicker class.

* string = obj.GetClassName ()
* int = obj.IsA (string name)
* vtkAbstractPropPicker = obj.NewInstance ()
* vtkAbstractPropPicker = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)
* obj.SetPath (vtkAssemblyPath ) - Return the
  vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path
  lists all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no
  assembly is present, then the assembly path will have one
  node (which is the picked prop). The set method is used
  internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of an
  assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each
  node pointing to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation
  matrix.)
* vtkAssemblyPath = obj.GetPath () - Return the
  vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path
  lists all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no
  assembly is present, then the assembly path will have one
  node (which is the picked prop). The set method is used
  internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of an
  assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each
  node pointing to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation
  matrix.)
* vtkProp = obj.GetViewProp () - Return the vtkProp that has
  been picked. If NULL, nothing was picked. If anything at
  all was picked, this method will return something.
* vtkProp3D = obj.GetProp3D () - Return the vtkProp that has
  been picked. If NULL, no vtkProp3D was picked.
* vtkActor = obj.GetActor () - Return the vtkActor that has
  been picked. If NULL, no actor was picked.
* vtkActor2D = obj.GetActor2D () - Return the vtkActor2D
  that has been picked. If NULL, no actor2D was picked.
* vtkVolume = obj.GetVolume () - Return the vtkVolume that
  has been picked. If NULL, no volume was picked.
* vtkAssembly = obj.GetAssembly () - Return the vtkAssembly
  that has been picked. If NULL, no assembly was picked.
  (Note: the returned assembly is the first node in the
  assembly path. If the path is one node long, then the
  assembly and the prop are the same, assuming that the
  first node is a vtkAssembly.)
* vtkPropAssembly = obj.GetPropAssembly () - Return the
  vtkPropAssembly that has been picked. If NULL, no prop
  assembly was picked. (Note: the returned prop assembly is
  the first node in the assembly path. If the path is one
  node long, then the prop assembly and the prop are the
  same, assuming that the first node is a vtkPropAssembly.)
* vtkProp = obj.GetProp () -
