<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>This class is used to represent a vtkHandleWidget. It represents a position in 3D world coordinates that is constrained to a specified plane. The default look is to draw a white point when this widget is not selected or active, a thin green circle when it is highlighted, and a thicker cyan circle when it is active (being positioned). Defaults can be adjusted - but take care to define cursor geometry that makes sense for this widget. The geometry will be aligned on the constraining plane, with the plane normal aligned with the X axis of the geometry (similar behavior to vtkGlyph3D).</p>
<p>TODO: still need to work on 1) translation when mouse is outside bounding planes 2) size of the widget</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation has several methods that can be used. They are listed below.

<li>
<code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code> - Standard methods for instances of this class.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation = obj.NewInstance ()</code> - Standard methods for instances of this class.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code> - Standard methods for instances of this class.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetCursorShape (vtkPolyData cursorShape)</code> - Specify the cursor shape. Keep in mind that the shape will be aligned with the constraining plane by orienting it such that the x axis of the geometry lies along the normal of the plane.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkPolyData = obj.GetCursorShape ()</code> - Specify the cursor shape. Keep in mind that the shape will be aligned with the constraining plane by orienting it such that the x axis of the geometry lies along the normal of the plane.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetActiveCursorShape (vtkPolyData activeShape)</code> - Specify the shape of the cursor (handle) when it is active. This is the geometry that will be used when the mouse is close to the handle or if the user is manipulating the handle.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkPolyData = obj.GetActiveCursorShape ()</code> - Specify the shape of the cursor (handle) when it is active. This is the geometry that will be used when the mouse is close to the handle or if the user is manipulating the handle.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetProjectionNormal (int )</code> - Set the projection normal to lie along the x, y, or z axis, or to be oblique. If it is oblique, then the plane is defined in the ObliquePlane ivar.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetProjectionNormalMinValue ()</code> - Set the projection normal to lie along the x, y, or z axis, or to be oblique. If it is oblique, then the plane is defined in the ObliquePlane ivar.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetProjectionNormalMaxValue ()</code> - Set the projection normal to lie along the x, y, or z axis, or to be oblique. If it is oblique, then the plane is defined in the ObliquePlane ivar.  </li>
<li>

<li>
<code>obj.SetProjectionNormalToXAxis ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetProjectionNormalToYAxis ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetProjectionNormalToZAxis ()</code>  </li>

<code>obj.SetProjectionNormalToOblique ()</code> - If the ProjectionNormal is set to Oblique, then this is the oblique plane used to constrain the handle position  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetObliquePlane (vtkPlane )</code> - If the ProjectionNormal is set to Oblique, then this is the oblique plane used to constrain the handle position  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkPlane = obj.GetObliquePlane ()</code> - If the ProjectionNormal is set to Oblique, then this is the oblique plane used to constrain the handle position  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetProjectionPosition (double position)</code> - The position of the bounding plane from the origin along the normal. The origin and normal are defined in the oblique plane when the ProjectionNormal is Oblique. For the X, Y, and Z axes projection normals, the normal is the axis direction, and the origin is (0,0,0).  </li>
<li>
<code>double = obj.GetProjectionPosition ()</code> - The position of the bounding plane from the origin along the normal. The origin and normal are defined in the oblique plane when the ProjectionNormal is Oblique. For the X, Y, and Z axes projection normals, the normal is the axis direction, and the origin is (0,0,0).  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.AddBoundingPlane (vtkPlane plane)</code> - A collection of plane equations used to bound the position of the point. This is in addition to confining the point to a plane - these contraints are meant to, for example, keep a point within the extent of an image. Using a set of plane equations allows for more complex bounds (such as bounding a point to an oblique reliced image that has hexagonal shape) than a simple extent.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.RemoveBoundingPlane (vtkPlane plane)</code> - A collection of plane equations used to bound the position of the point. This is in addition to confining the point to a plane - these contraints are meant to, for example, keep a point within the extent of an image.
