Usage</h1>
<p>vtkRuledSurfaceFilter is a filter that generates a surface from a set of lines. The lines are assumed to be "parallel" in the sense that they do not intersect and remain somewhat close to one another. A surface is generated by connecting the points defining each pair of lines with straight lines. This creates a strip for each pair of lines (i.e., a triangulation is created from two generating lines). The filter can handle an arbitrary number of lines, with lines i and i+1 assumed connected. Note that there are several different approaches for creating the ruled surface, the method for creating the surface can either use the input points or resample from the polylines (using a user-specified resolution).</p>
<p>This filter offers some other important features. A DistanceFactor ivar is used to decide when two lines are too far apart to connect. (The factor is a multiple of the distance between the first two points of the two lines defining the strip.) If the distance between the two generating lines becomes too great, then the surface is not generated in that region. (Note: if the lines separate and then merge, then a hole can be generated in the surface.) In addition, the Offset and OnRation ivars can be used to create nifty striped surfaces. Closed surfaces (e.g., tubes) can be created by setting the CloseSurface ivar. (The surface can be closed in the other direction by repeating the first and last point in the polylines defining the surface.)</p>
<p>An important use of this filter is to combine it with vtkStreamLine to generate stream surfaces. It can also be used to create surfaces from contours.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkRuledSurfaceFilter, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
