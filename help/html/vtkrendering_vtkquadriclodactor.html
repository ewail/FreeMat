<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>vtkQuadricLODActor implements a specific strategy for level-of-detail using the vtkQuadricClustering decimation algorithm. It supports only two levels of detail: full resolution and a decimated version. The decimated LOD is generated using a tuned strategy to produce output consistent with the requested interactive frame rate (i.e., the vtkRenderWindowInteractor's DesiredUpdateRate). It also makes use of display lists for performance, and adjusts the vtkQuadricClustering algorithm to take into account the dimensionality of the data (e.g., 2D, x-y surfaces may be binned into n x n x 1 to reduce extra polygons in the z-direction). Finally, the filter may optionally be set in "Static" mode (this works with the vtkMapper::SetStatic() method). `Enabling Static results in a one time execution of the Mapper's pipeline. After that, the pipeline no longer updated (unless manually forced to do so).</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkQuadricLODActor, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkQuadricLODActor
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkQuadricLODActor has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkQuadricLODActor class. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code> - Standard class methods.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code> - Standard class methods.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkQuadricLODActor = obj.NewInstance ()</code> - Standard class methods.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkQuadricLODActor = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code> - Standard class methods.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetDeferLODConstruction (int )</code> - Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render) or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default, LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetDeferLODConstruction ()</code> - Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render) or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default, LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.DeferLODConstructionOn ()</code> - Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render) or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default, LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.DeferLODConstructionOff ()</code> - Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render) or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default, LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetStatic (int )</code> - Turn on/off a flag to control whether the underlying pipeline is static. If static, this means that the data pipeline executes once and then not again until the user manually modifies this class. By default, Static is off because trying to debug this is tricky, and you should only use it when you know what you are doing.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetStatic ()</code> - Turn on/off a flag to control whether the underlying pipeline is static. If static, this means that the data pipeline executes once and then not again until the user manually modifies this class. By default, Static is off because trying to debug this is tricky, and you should only use it when you know what you are doing.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.StaticOn ()</code> - Turn on/off a flag to control whether the underlying pipeline is static. If static, this means that the data pipeline executes once and then not again until the user manually modifies this class. By default, Static is off because trying to debug this is tricky, and you should only use it when you know what you are doing.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.StaticOff ()</code> - Turn on/off a flag to control whether the underlying pipeline is static. If static, this means that the data pipeline executes once and then not again until the user manually modifies this class. By default, Static is off because trying to debug this is tricky, and you should only use it when you know what you are doing.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetDataConfiguration (int )</code> - Force the binning of the quadric clustering according to application knowledge relative to the dimension of the data. For example, if you know your data lies in a 2D x-y plane, the performance of the quadric clustering algorithm can be greatly improved by indicating this (i.e., the number of resulting triangles, and the quality of the decimation version is better). Setting this parameter forces the binning to be configured consistent with the dimnesionality of the data, and the collapse dimension ratio is ignored. Specifying the value of DataConfiguration to UNKNOWN (the default value) means that the class will attempt to figure the dimension of the class automatically using the CollapseDimensionRatio ivar.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetDataConfigurationMinValue ()</code> - Force the binning of the quadric clustering according to application knowledge relative to the dimension of the data. For example, if you know your data lies in a 2D x-y plane, the performance of the quadric clustering algorithm can be greatly improved by indicating this (i.e., the number of resulting triangles, and the quality of the decimation version is better). Setting this parameter forces the binning to be configured consistent with the dimnesionality of the data, and the collapse dimension ratio is ignored.
