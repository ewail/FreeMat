<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>This class is a concrete representation for the vtkSphereWidget2. It represents a sphere with an optional handle. Through interaction with the widget, the sphere can be arbitrarily positioned and scaled in 3D space; and the handle can be moved on the surface of the sphere. Typically the vtkSphereWidget2/vtkSphereRepresentation are used to position a sphere for the purpose of extracting, cutting or clipping data; or the handle is moved on the sphere to position a light or camera.</p>
<p>To use this representation, you normally use the PlaceWidget() method to position the widget at a specified region in space. It is also possible to set the center of the sphere, a radius, and/or a handle position.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkSphereRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkSphereRepresentation
