<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>This class is a concrete representation for the vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2. It represents an infinite plane defined by a normal and point in the context of a bounding box. Through interaction with the widget, the plane can be manipulated by adjusting the plane normal or moving the origin point.</p>
<p>To use this representation, you normally define a (plane) origin and (plane) normal. The PlaceWidget() method is also used to intially position the representation.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
