<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>vtkLODProp3D is a class to support level of detail rendering for Prop3D. Any number of mapper/property/texture items can be added to this object. Render time will be measured, and will be used to select a LOD based on the AllocatedRenderTime of this Prop3D. Depending on the type of the mapper/property, a vtkActor or a vtkVolume will be created behind the scenes.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkLODProp3D, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkLODProp3D
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkLODProp3D has several methods that can be used. They are listed below.
