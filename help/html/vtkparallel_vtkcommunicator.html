<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>This is an abstact class which contains functionality for sending and receiving inter-process messages. It contains methods for marshaling an object into a string (currently used by the MPI communicator but not the shared memory communicator).</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkCommunicator, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkCommunicator
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkCommunicator has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkCommunicator class. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkCommunicator = obj.NewInstance ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkCommunicator = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetNumberOfProcesses (int num)</code> - Set the number of processes you will be using. This defaults to the maximum number available. If you set this to a value higher than the default, you will get an error.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetNumberOfProcesses ()</code> - Set the number of processes you will be using. This defaults to the maximum number available. If you set this to a value higher than the default, you will get an error.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetLocalProcessId ()</code> - Tells you which process [0, NumProcess) you are in.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (vtkDataObject data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - This method sends a data object to a destination. Tag eliminates ambiguity and is used to match sends to receives.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (vtkDataArray data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - This method sends a data array to a destination. Tag eliminates ambiguity and is used to match sends to receives.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (int data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (int data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (long data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (string data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (string data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (float data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Send (double data, vtkIdType length, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for sending data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (vtkDataObject data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - This method receives a data object from a corresponding send. It blocks until the receive is finished.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkDataObject = obj.ReceiveDataObject (int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - The caller does not have to know the data type before this call is made. It returns the newly created object.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (vtkDataArray data, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - This method receives a data array from a corresponding send. It blocks until the receive is finished.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (int data, vtkIdType maxlength, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for receiving data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (int data, vtkIdType maxlength, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for receiving data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (long data, vtkIdType maxlength, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for receiving data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (string data, vtkIdType maxlength, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for receiving data arrays.  </li>

<li>
<code>int = obj.Receive (double data, vtkIdType maxlength, int remoteHandle, int tag)</code> - Convenience methods for receiving data arrays.  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkIdType = obj.GetCount ()</code> - Returns the number of words received by the most recent Receive(). Note that this is not the number of bytes received, but the number of items of the data-type received by the most recent Receive() eg. if Receive(int*,..) was used, then this returns the number of ints received; if Receive(double*,..) was used, then this returns the number of doubles received etc. The return value is valid only after a successful Receive().  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.Barrier ()</code> - Will block the processes until all other processes reach the Barrier function.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.Broadcast (int data, vtkIdType length, int srcProcessId)</code> - Broadcast sends the array in the process with id <code>srcProcessId</code> to all of the other processes. All processes must call these method with the same arguments in order for it to complete.  </li>
