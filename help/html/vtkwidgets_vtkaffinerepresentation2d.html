<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>This class is used to represent a vtkAffineWidget. This representation consists of three parts: a box, a circle, and a cross. The box is used for scaling and shearing, the circle for rotation, and the cross for translation. These parts are drawn in the overlay plane and maintain a constant size (width and height) specified in terms of normalized viewport coordinates.</p>
<p>The representation maintains an internal transformation matrix (see superclass' GetTransform() method). The transformations generated by this widget assume that the representation lies in the x-y plane. If this is not the case, the user is responsible for transforming this representation's matrix into the correct coordinate space (by judicious matrix multiplication). Note that the transformation matrix returned by GetTransform() is relative to the last PlaceWidget() invocation. (The PlaceWidget() sets the origin around which rotation and scaling occurs; the origin is the center point of the bounding box provided.)</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkAffineRepresentation2D, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
