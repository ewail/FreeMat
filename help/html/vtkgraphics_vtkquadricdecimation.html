Usage</h1>
<p>vtkQuadricDecimation is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The input to vtkQuadricDecimation is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles are treated. If you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate the polygons with vtkTriangleFilter.</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on repeated edge collapses until the requested mesh reduction is achieved. Edges are placed in a priority queue based on the "cost" to delete the edge. The cost is an approximate measure of error (distance to the original surface)&ndash;described by the so-called quadric error measure. The quadric error measure is associated with each vertex of the mesh and represents a matrix of planes incident on that vertex. The distance of the planes to the vertex is the error in the position of the vertex (originally the vertex error iz zero). As edges are deleted, the quadric error measure associated with the two end points of the edge are summed (this combines the plane equations) and an optimal collapse point can be computed. Edges connected to the collapse point are then reinserted into the queue after computing the new cost to delete them. The process continues until the desired reduction level is reached or topological constraints prevent further reduction. Note that this basic algorithm can be extended to higher dimensions by taking into account variation in attributes (i.e., scalars, vectors, and so on).</p>
<p>This paper is based on the work of Garland and Heckbert who first presented the quadric error measure at Siggraph '97 "Surface
 Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics". For details of the algorithm Michael Garland's Ph.D. thesis is also recommended. Hughues Hoppe's Vis '99 paper, "New Quadric Metric for Simplifying Meshes with Appearance
 Attributes" is also a good take on the subject especially as it pertains to the error metric applied to attributes.</p>
