<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>vtkParametricSpline is a parametric function for 1D interpolating splines. vtkParametricSpline maps the single parameter u into a 3D point (x,y,z) using three instances of interpolating splines. This family of 1D splines is quaranteed to be parameterized in the interval [0,1]. Attempting to evaluate outside this interval will cause the parameter u to be clamped in the range [0,1].</p>
<p>When constructed, this class creates instances of vtkCardinalSpline for each of the x-y-z coordinates. The user may choose to replace these with their own instances of subclasses of vtkSpline.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkParametricSpline, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkParametricSpline
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkParametricSpline has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkParametricSpline class. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkParametricSpline = obj.NewInstance ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkParametricSpline = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetDimension ()</code> - Evaluate the spline at parametric coordinate u[0] returning the point coordinate Pt[3].  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.Evaluate (double u[3], double Pt[3], double Du[9])</code> - Evaluate the spline at parametric coordinate u[0] returning the point coordinate Pt[3].  </li>
<li>
<code>double = obj.EvaluateScalar (double u[3], double Pt[3], double Du[9])</code> - Evaluate a scalar value at parametric coordinate u[0] and Pt[3]. The scalar value is just the parameter u[0].  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetXSpline (vtkSpline )</code> - By default, this class is constructed with three instances of vtkCardinalSpline (for each of the x-y-z coordinate axes). The user may choose to create and assign their own instances of vtkSpline.  </li>

<li>
<code>obj.SetPoints (vtkPoints )</code> - Specify the list of points defining the spline. Do this by specifying a vtkPoints array containing the points. Note that the order of the points in vtkPoints is the order that the splines will be fit.  </li>
