Usage</h1>
<p>This class tessellates parametric functions. The user must specify how many points in the parametric coordinate directions are required (i.e., the resolution), and the mode to use to generate scalars.</p>

SCALAR_Z, the scalar is set to the z-value. SCALAR_DISTANCE, the scalar is set to (sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)). I.e. distance from the origin. SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED, the scalar is set to the value returned from EvaluateScalar().  </li>
