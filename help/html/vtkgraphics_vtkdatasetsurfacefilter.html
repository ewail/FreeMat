<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter is a faster version of vtkGeometry filter, but it does not have an option to select bounds. It may use more memory than vtkGeometryFilter. It only has one option: whether to use triangle strips when the input type is structured.</p>
<p>To create an instance of class vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter, simply invoke its constructor as follows </p>
<pre class="fragment">  obj = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter
</pre> <h1><a class="anchor" id="Methods"></a>
Methods</h1>
<p>The class vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <code>obj</code> is an instance of the vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter class. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string = obj.GetClassName ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.IsA (string name)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter = obj.NewInstance ()</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</code>  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetUseStrips (int )</code> - When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with triangle strips. This should render faster and use less memory, but no cell data is copied. By default, UseStrips is Off.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetUseStrips ()</code> - When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with triangle strips. This should render faster and use less memory, but no cell data is copied. By default, UseStrips is Off.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.UseStripsOn ()</code> - When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with triangle strips. This should render faster and use less memory, but no cell data is copied. By default, UseStrips is Off.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.UseStripsOff ()</code> - When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with triangle strips. This should render faster and use less memory, but no cell data is copied. By default, UseStrips is Off.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetPieceInvariant (int )</code> - If PieceInvariant is true, vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter requests 1 ghost level from input in order to remove internal surface that are between processes. False by default.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetPieceInvariant ()</code> - If PieceInvariant is true, vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter requests 1 ghost level from input in order to remove internal surface that are between processes. False by default.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetPassThroughCellIds (int )</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetPassThroughCellIds ()</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.PassThroughCellIdsOn ()</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.PassThroughCellIdsOff ()</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>
<li>
<code>obj.SetPassThroughPointIds (int )</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.GetPassThroughPointIds ()</code> - If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on, since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the input cells.  </li>

<li>
<code>int = obj.StructuredExecute (vtkDataSet input, vtkPolyData output, int ext32, int wholeExt32)</code> - Direct access methods that can be used to use the this class as an algorithm without using it as a filter.  </li>
<li>
<code>int = obj.UnstructuredGridExecute (vtkDataSet input, vtkPolyData output)</code> - Direct access methods that can be used to use the this class as an algorithm without using it as a filter.  </li>

<code>int = obj.DataSetExecute (vtkDataSet input, vtkPolyData output)</code> - Direct access methods that can be used to use the this class as an algorithm without using it as a filter.  </li>
