<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>vtkGL2PSExporter is a concrete subclass of vtkExporter that writes high quality vector PostScript (PS/EPS), PDF or SVG files by using GL2PS. GL2PS can be obtained at: <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/">http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/</a>. This can be very useful when one requires publication quality pictures. This class works best with simple 3D scenes and most 2D plots. Please note that GL2PS has its limitations since PostScript is not an ideal language to represent complex 3D scenes. However, this class does allow one to write mixed vector/raster files by using the Write3DPropsAsRasterImage ivar. Please do read the caveats section of this documentation.</p>
<p>By default vtkGL2PSExporter generates Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) output along with the text in portrait orientation with the background color of the window being drawn. The generated output is also compressed using zlib. The various other options are set to sensible defaults.</p>
<p>The output file format (FileFormat) can be either PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), PDF, SVG or TeX. The file extension is generated automatically depending on the FileFormat. The default is EPS. When TeX output is chosen, only the text strings in the plot are generated and put into a picture environment. One can turn on and off the text when generating PS/EPS/PDF/SVG files by using the Text boolean variable. By default the text is drawn. The background color of the renderwindow is drawn by default. To make the background white instead use the DrawBackgroundOff function. Landscape figures can be generated by using the LandscapeOn function. Portrait orientation is used by default. Several of the GL2PS options can be set. The names of the ivars for these options are similar to the ones that GL2PS provides. Compress, SimpleLineOffset, Silent, BestRoot, PS3Shading and OcclusionCull are similar to the options provided by GL2PS. Please read the function documentation or the GL2PS documentation for more details. The ivar Write3DPropsAsRasterImage allows one to generate mixed vector/raster images. All the 3D props in the scene will be written as a raster image and all 2D actors will be written as vector graphic primitives. This makes it possible to handle transparency and complex 3D scenes. This ivar is set to Off by default. When drawing lines and points the OpenGL point size and line width are multiplied by a factor in order to generate PostScript lines and points of the right size. The Get/SetGlobalPointSizeFactor and Get/SetGlobalLineWidthFactor let one customize this ratio. The default value is such that the PostScript output looks close to what is seen on screen.</p>
<p>To use this class you need to turn on VTK_USE_GL2PS when configuring VTK.</p>
