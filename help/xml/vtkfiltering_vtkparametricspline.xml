<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkParametricSpline is a parametric function for 1D interpolating splines. vtkParametricSpline maps the single parameter u into a 3D point (x,y,z) using three instances of interpolating splines. This family of 1D splines is quaranteed to be parameterized in the interval [0,1]. Attempting to evaluate outside this interval will cause the parameter u to be clamped in the range [0,1].</para><para>When constructed, this class creates instances of vtkCardinalSpline for each of the x-y-z coordinates. The user may choose to replace these with their own instances of subclasses of vtkSpline.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkParametricSpline, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkParametricSpline
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
