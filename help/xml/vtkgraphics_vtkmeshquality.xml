<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkMeshQuality computes one or more functions of (geometric) quality for each 2-D and 3-D cell (triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron, or hexahedron) of a mesh. These functions of quality are then averaged over the entire mesh. The minimum, average, maximum, and unbiased variance of quality for each type of cell is stored in the output mesh&apos;s FieldData. The FieldData arrays are named &quot;Mesh Triangle Quality,&quot; &quot;Mesh Quadrilateral Quality,&quot; &quot;Mesh Tetrahedron Quality,&quot; and &quot;Mesh Hexahedron Quality.&quot; Each array has a single tuple with 5 components. The first 4 components are the quality statistics mentioned above; the final value is the number of cells of the given type. This final component makes aggregation of statistics for distributed mesh data possible.</para><para>By default, the per-cell quality is added to the mesh&apos;s cell data, in an array named &quot;Quality.&quot; Cell types not supported by this filter will have an entry of 0. Use SaveCellQualityOff() to store only the final statistics.</para><para>This version of the filter written by Philippe Pebay and David Thompson overtakes an older version written by Leila Baghdadi, Hanif Ladak, and David Steinman at the Imaging Research Labs, Robarts Research Institute. That version only supported tetrahedral radius ratio. See the CompatibilityModeOn() member for information on how to make this filter behave like the previous implementation. For more information on the triangle quality functions of this class, cf. Pebay &amp; Baker 2003, Analysis of triangle quality measures, Math Comp 72:244. For more information on the quadrangle quality functions of this class, cf. Pebay 2004, Planar Quadrangle Quality Measures, Eng Comp 20:2.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkMeshQuality, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkMeshQuality
