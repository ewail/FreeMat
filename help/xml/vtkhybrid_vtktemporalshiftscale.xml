<para>vtkTemporalShiftScale modify the time range or time steps of the data without changing the data itself. The data is not resampled by this filter, only the information accompanying the data is modified.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkTemporalShiftScale, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkTemporalShiftScale

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkTemporalShiftScale has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkTemporalShiftScale class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetPeriodic (int )</computeroutput> - If Periodic is true, requests for time will be wrapped around so that the source appears to be a periodic time source. If data exists for times {0,N-1}, setting periodic to true will cause time 0 to be produced when time N, 2N, 2N etc is requested. This effectively gives the source the ability to generate time data indefinitely in a loop. When combined with Shift/Scale, the time becomes periodic in the shifted and scaled time frame of reference. Note: Since the input time may not start at zero, the wrapping of time from the end of one period to the start of the next, will subtract the initial time - a source with T{5..6} repeated periodicaly will have output time {5..6..7..8} etc.  </para></listitem>
