<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class is used to interpolate a series of cameras to update a specified camera. Either linear interpolation or spline interpolation may be used. The instance variables currently interpolated include position, focal point, view up, view angle, parallel scale, and clipping range.</para><para>To use this class, specify the type of interpolation to use, and add a series of cameras at various times &quot;t&quot; to the list of cameras from which to interpolate. Then to interpolate in between cameras, simply invoke the function InterpolateCamera(t,camera) where &quot;camera&quot; is the camera to be updated with interpolated values. Note that &quot;t&quot; should be in the range (min,max) times specified with the AddCamera() method. If outside this range, the interpolation is clamped. This class copies the camera information (as compared to referencing the cameras) so you do not need to keep separate instances of the camera around for each camera added to the list of cameras to interpolate.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkCameraInterpolator, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkCameraInterpolator
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<para>The class vtkCameraInterpolator has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website.

<para><computeroutput>obj.InterpolateCamera (double t, vtkCamera camera)</computeroutput> - Interpolate the list of cameras and determine a new camera (i.e., fill in the camera provided). If t is outside the range of (min,max) values, then t is clamped to lie within this range.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetInterpolationType (int )</computeroutput> - These are convenience methods to switch between linear and spline interpolation.
