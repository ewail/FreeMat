<title>Usage</title>
<para>The vtkContourWidget is used to select a set of points, and draw lines between these points. The contour may be opened or closed, depending on how the last point is added. The widget handles all processing of widget events (that are triggered by VTK events). The vtkContourRepresentation is responsible for all placement of the points, calculation of the lines, and contour manipulation. This is done through two main helper classes: vtkPointPlacer and vtkContourLineInterpolator. The representation is also responsible for drawing the points and lines.</para><para>.SECTION Event Bindings By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events): <preformatted>
   LeftButtonPressEvent - triggers a Select event
   RightButtonPressEvent - triggers a AddFinalPoint event
   MouseMoveEvent - triggers a Move event
   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - triggers an EndSelect event
   Delete key event - triggers a Delete event
   Shift + Delete key event - triggers a Reset event
 </preformatted></para><para>Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this class&apos;s vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events into the vtkContourWidget&apos;s widget events: <preformatted>
   vtkWidgetEvent::Select 
        widget state is: 
            Start or
            Define: If we already have at least 2 nodes, test
                 whether the current (X,Y) location is near an existing
                 node. If so, close the contour and change to Manipulate
                 state. Otherwise, attempt to add a node at this (X,Y)
                 location.
            Manipulate: If this (X,Y) location activates a node, then
                 set the current operation to Translate. Otherwise, if
                 this location is near the contour, attempt to add a 
                 new node on the contour at this (X,Y) location.</preformatted></para><para><preformatted>   vtkWidgetEvent::AddFinalPoint
        widget state is:

                 node. If so, close the contour and change to Manipulate
                 state. Otherwise, attempt to add a node at this (X,Y)
                 location. If we do, then leave the contour open and
                 change to Manipulate state.

                  WidgetInteraction() on the representation. If our
