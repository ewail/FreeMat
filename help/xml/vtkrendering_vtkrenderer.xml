<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkRenderer provides an abstract specification for renderers. A renderer is an object that controls the rendering process for objects. Rendering is the process of converting geometry, a specification for lights, and a camera view into an image. vtkRenderer also performs coordinate transformation between world coordinates, view coordinates (the computer graphics rendering coordinate system), and display coordinates (the actual screen coordinates on the display device). Certain advanced rendering features such as two-sided lighting can also be controlled.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkRenderer, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkRenderer

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetOcclusionRatio (double )</computeroutput> - In case of use of depth peeling technique for rendering translucent material, define the threshold under which the algorithm stops to iterate over peel layers. This is the ratio of the number of pixels that have been touched by the last layer over the total number of pixels of the viewport area. Initial value is 0.0, meaning rendering have to be exact. Greater values may speed-up the rendering with small impact on the quality.  </para></listitem>
