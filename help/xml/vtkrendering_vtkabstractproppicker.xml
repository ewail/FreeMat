<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkAbstractPropPicker is an abstract superclass for pickers that can pick an instance of vtkProp. Some pickers, like vtkWorldPointPicker (not a subclass of this class), cannot identify the prop that is picked. Subclasses of vtkAbstractPropPicker return a prop in the form of a vtkAssemblyPath when a pick is invoked. Note that an vtkAssemblyPath contain a list of vtkAssemblyNodes, each of which in turn contains a reference to a vtkProp and a 4x4 transformation matrix. The path fully describes the entire pick path, so you can pick assemblies or portions of assemblies, or just grab the tail end of the vtkAssemblyPath (which is the picked prop).</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkAbstractPropPicker, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkAbstractPropPicker
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkAbstractPropPicker has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkAbstractPropPicker class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetPath (vtkAssemblyPath )</computeroutput> - Return the vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path lists all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no assembly is present, then the assembly path will have one node (which is the picked prop). The set method is used internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of an assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each node pointing to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation matrix.)  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkAssemblyPath = obj.GetPath ()</computeroutput> - Return the vtkAssemblyPath that has been picked. The assembly path lists all the vtkProps that form an assembly. If no assembly is present, then the assembly path will have one node (which is the picked prop). The set method is used internally to set the path. (Note: the structure of an assembly path is a collection of vtkAssemblyNode, each node pointing to a vtkProp and (possibly) a transformation matrix.)  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>vtkProp = obj.GetViewProp ()</computeroutput> - Return the vtkProp that has been picked. If NULL, nothing was picked. If anything at all was picked, this method will return something.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkProp3D = obj.GetProp3D ()</computeroutput> - Return the vtkProp that has been picked. If NULL, no vtkProp3D was picked.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkAssembly = obj.GetAssembly ()</computeroutput> - Return the vtkAssembly that has been picked. If NULL, no assembly was picked. (Note: the returned assembly is the first node in the assembly path. If the path is one node long, then the assembly and the prop are the same, assuming that the first node is a vtkAssembly.)  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkPropAssembly = obj.GetPropAssembly ()</computeroutput> - Return the vtkPropAssembly that has been picked. If NULL, no prop assembly was picked.
