<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkPLYWriter writes polygonal data in Stanford University PLY format (see <ulink url="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/</ulink>). The data can be written in either binary (little or big endian) or ASCII representation. As for PointData and CellData, vtkPLYWriter cannot handle normals or vectors. It only handles RGB PointData and CellData. You need to set the name of the array (using SetName for the array and SetArrayName for the writer). If the array is not a vtkUnsignedCharArray with 3 components, you need to specify a vtkLookupTable to map the scalars to RGB.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkPLYWriter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkPLYWriter

The user provides the name of an array and a component number. If the type of the array is three components, unsigned char, then the data is written as three separate &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; properties. If the type is not unsigned char, and a lookup table is provided, then the array/component are mapped through the table to generate three separate &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; properties in the PLY file. The user can also set the ColorMode to specify a uniform color for the whole part (on a vertex colors, face colors, or both. (Note: vertex colors or cell colors may be written, depending on where the named array is found. If points and cells have the arrays with the same name, then both colors will be written.)  </para></listitem>
