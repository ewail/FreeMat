<title>Usage</title>
<para>The vtkSeedRepresentation is a superclass for classes representing the vtkSeedWidget. This representation consists of one or more handles (vtkHandleRepresentation) which are used to place and manipulate the points defining the collection of seeds.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkSeedRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkSeedRepresentation
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkSeedRepresentation has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkSeedRepresentation class. <itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>string = obj.GetClassName ()</computeroutput> - Standard VTK methods.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>int = obj.IsA (string name)</computeroutput> - Standard VTK methods.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkSeedRepresentation = obj.NewInstance ()</computeroutput> - Standard VTK methods.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkSeedRepresentation = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</computeroutput> - Standard VTK methods.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.GetSeedWorldPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])</computeroutput> - Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining this representation. Note that methods are available for both display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed number.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetSeedDisplayPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])</computeroutput> - Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining this representation. Note that methods are available for both display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed number.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.GetSeedDisplayPosition (int seedNum, double pos[3])</computeroutput> - Methods to Set/Get the coordinates of seed points defining this representation. Note that methods are available for both display and world coordinates. The seeds are accessed by a seed number.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>int = obj.GetNumberOfSeeds ()</computeroutput> - Return the number of seeds (or handles) that have been created.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetHandleRepresentation (vtkHandleRepresentation handle)</computeroutput> - This method is used to specify the type of handle representation to use for the internal vtkHandleWidgets within vtkSeedWidget. To use this method, create a dummy vtkHandleWidget (or subclass), and then invoke this method with this dummy. Then the vtkSeedRepresentation uses this dummy to clone vtkHandleWidgets of the same type. Make sure you set the handle representation before the widget is enabled.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>vtkHandleRepresentation = obj.GetHandleRepresentation (int num)</computeroutput> - Get the handle representations used for a particular seed. A side effect of this method is that it will create a handle representation in the list of representations if one has not yet been created.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>vtkHandleRepresentation = obj.GetHandleRepresentation ()</computeroutput> - Returns the model HandleRepresentation.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetTolerance (int )</computeroutput> - The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of the widget to be active.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>int = obj.GetToleranceMinValue ()</computeroutput> - The tolerance representing the distance to the widget (in pixels) in which the cursor is considered near enough to the end points of the widget to be active.  </para></listitem>
