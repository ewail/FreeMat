<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class is a concrete representation for the vtkSphereWidget2. It represents a sphere with an optional handle. Through interaction with the widget, the sphere can be arbitrarily positioned and scaled in 3D space; and the handle can be moved on the surface of the sphere. Typically the vtkSphereWidget2/vtkSphereRepresentation are used to position a sphere for the purpose of extracting, cutting or clipping data; or the handle is moved on the sphere to position a light or camera.</para><para>To use this representation, you normally use the PlaceWidget() method to position the widget at a specified region in space. It is also possible to set the center of the sphere, a radius, and/or a handle position.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkSphereRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkSphereRepresentation
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
