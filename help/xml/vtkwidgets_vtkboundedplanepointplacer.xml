<para><computeroutput>int = obj.ComputeWorldPosition (vtkRenderer ren, double displayPos[2], double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</computeroutput> - Given a renderer and a display position, compute the world position and world orientation for this point. A plane is defined by a combination of the ProjectionNormal, ProjectionOrigin, and ObliquePlane ivars. The display position is projected onto this plane to determine a world position, and the orientation is set to the normal of the plane. If the point cannot project onto the plane or if it falls outside the bounds imposed by the BoundingPlanes, then 0 is returned, otherwise 1 is returned to indicate a valid return position and orientation.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>int = obj.ComputeWorldPosition (vtkRenderer ren, double displayPos[2], double refWorldPos[3], double worldPos[3], double worldOrient[9])</computeroutput> - Given a renderer, a display position, and a reference world position, compute the new world position and orientation of this point.

<para><computeroutput>int = obj.ValidateWorldPosition (double worldPos[3])</computeroutput> - Give a world position check if it is valid - does it lie on the plane and within the bounds? Returns 1 if it is valid, 0 otherwise.  </para></listitem>
