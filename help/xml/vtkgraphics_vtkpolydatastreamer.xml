<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkPolyDataStreamer initiates streaming by requesting pieces from its single input it appends these pieces it to the requested output. Note that since vtkPolyDataStreamer uses an append filter, all the polygons generated have to be kept in memory before rendering. If these do not fit in the memory, it is possible to make the vtkPolyDataMapper stream. Since the mapper will render each piece separately, all the polygons do not have to stored in memory. .SECTION Note The output may be slightly different if the pipeline does not handle ghost cells properly (i.e. you might see seames between the pieces).</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataStreamer, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkPolyDataStreamer
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
