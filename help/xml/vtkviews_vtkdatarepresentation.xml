<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkDataRepresentation the superclass for representations of data objects. This class itself may be instantiated and used as a representation that simply holds a connection to a pipeline.</para><para>If there are multiple representations present in a view, you should use a subclass of vtkDataRepresentation. The representation is responsible for taking the input pipeline connection and converting it to an object usable by a view. In the most common case, the representation will contain the pipeline necessary to convert a data object into an actor or set of actors.</para><para>The representation has a concept of a selection. If the user performs a selection operation on the view, the view forwards this on to its representations. The representation is responsible for displaying that selection in an appropriate way.</para><para>Representation selections may also be linked. The representation shares the selection by converting it into a view-independent format, then setting the selection on its vtkAnnotationLink. Other representations sharing the same selection link instance will get the same selection from the selection link when the view is updated. The application is responsible for linking representations as appropriate by setting the same vtkAnnotationLink on each linked representation.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkDataRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkDataRepresentation
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkDataRepresentation has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkDataRepresentation class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.ApplyViewTheme (vtkViewTheme )</computeroutput> - The view calls this method when a selection occurs. The representation takes this selection and converts it into a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection, then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection. Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead override ConvertSelection. The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be added to the previous selection on this representation.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.Select (vtkView view, vtkSelection selection)</computeroutput> - The view calls this method when a selection occurs. The representation takes this selection and converts it into a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection, then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection. Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead override ConvertSelection. The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be added to the previous selection on this representation.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.Select (vtkView view, vtkSelection selection, bool extend)</computeroutput> - The view calls this method when a selection occurs. The representation takes this selection and converts it into a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection, then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection. Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead override ConvertSelection. The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be added to the previous selection on this representation.  </para></listitem>
