<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkGraphLayoutFilter will reposition a network of nodes, connected by lines or polylines, into a more pleasing arrangement. The class implements a simple force-directed placement algorithm (Fruchterman &amp; Reingold &quot;Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement&quot; Software-Practice and Experience 21(11) 1991).</para><para>The input to the filter is a vtkPolyData representing the undirected graphs. A graph is represented by a set of polylines and/or lines. The output is also a vtkPolyData, where the point positions have been modified. To use the filter, specify whether you wish the layout to occur in 2D or 3D; the bounds in which the graph should lie (note that you can just use automatic bounds computation); and modify the cool down rate (controls the final process of simulated annealing).</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkGraphLayoutFilter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkGraphLayoutFilter
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
