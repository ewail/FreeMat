<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkConeSource creates a cone centered at a specified point and pointing in a specified direction. (By default, the center is the origin and the direction is the x-axis.) Depending upon the resolution of this object, different representations are created. If resolution=0 a line is created; if resolution=1, a single triangle is created; if resolution=2, two crossed triangles are created. For resolution &gt; 2, a 3D cone (with resolution number of sides) is created. It also is possible to control whether the bottom of the cone is capped with a (resolution-sided) polygon, and to specify the height and radius of the cone.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkConeSource, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkConeSource
