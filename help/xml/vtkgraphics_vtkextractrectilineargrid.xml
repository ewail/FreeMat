<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkExtractRectilinearGrid rounds out the set of filters that extract a subgrid out of a larger structured data set. RIght now, this filter only supports extracting a VOI. In the future, it might support strides like the vtkExtract grid filter.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkExtractRectilinearGrid, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkExtractRectilinearGrid
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkExtractRectilinearGrid has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkExtractRectilinearGrid class. <itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetVOI (int , int , int , int , int , int )</computeroutput> - Specify i-j-k (min,max) pairs to extract. The resulting structured grid dataset can be of any topological dimension (i.e., point, line, plane, or 3D grid).  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetVOI (int a[6])</computeroutput> - Specify i-j-k (min,max) pairs to extract. The resulting structured grid dataset can be of any topological dimension (i.e., point, line, plane, or 3D grid).  </para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetSampleRate (int , int , int )</computeroutput> - Set the sampling rate in the i, j, and k directions. If the rate is &gt; 1, then the resulting VOI will be subsampled representation of the input. For example, if the SampleRate=(2,2,2), every other point will be selected, resulting in a volume 1/8th the original size.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetSampleRate (int a[3])</computeroutput> - Set the sampling rate in the i, j, and k directions.

For example, if the SampleRate=(2,2,2), every other point will be selected, resulting in a volume 1/8th the original size.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetIncludeBoundary (int )</computeroutput> - Control whether to enforce that the &quot;boundary&quot; of the grid is output in the subsampling process. (This ivar only has effect when the SampleRate in any direction is not equal to 1.) When this ivar IncludeBoundary is on, the subsampling will always include the boundary of the grid even though the sample rate is not an even multiple of the grid dimensions. (By default IncludeBoundary is off.)  </para></listitem>
