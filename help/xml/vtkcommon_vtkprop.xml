<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkProp is an abstract superclass for any objects that can exist in a rendered scene (either 2D or 3D). Instances of vtkProp may respond to various render methods (e.g., RenderOpaqueGeometry()). vtkProp also defines the API for picking, LOD manipulation, and common instance variables that control visibility, picking, and dragging.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkProp, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkProp
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<para>The class vtkProp has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website.

<para><computeroutput>obj.InitPathTraversal ()</computeroutput> - vtkProp and its subclasses can be picked by subclasses of vtkAbstractPicker (e.g., vtkPropPicker). The following methods interface with the picking classes and return &quot;pick paths&quot;. A pick path is a hierarchical, ordered list of props that form an assembly. Most often, when a vtkProp is picked, its path consists of a single node (i.e., the prop). However, classes like vtkAssembly and vtkPropAssembly can return more than one path, each path being several layers deep. (See vtkAssemblyPath for more information.) To use these methods - first invoke InitPathTraversal() followed by repeated calls to GetNextPath(). GetNextPath() returns a NULL pointer when the list is exhausted.  </para></listitem>
