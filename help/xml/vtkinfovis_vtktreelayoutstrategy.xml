<title>Usage</title>
<para>Assigns points to the nodes of a tree in either a standard or radial layout. The standard layout places each level on a horizontal line, while the radial layout places each level on a concentric circle. You may specify the sweep angle of the tree which constrains the tree to be contained within a wedge. Also, you may indicate the log scale of the tree, which diminishes the length of arcs at lower levels of the tree. Values near zero give a large proportion of the space to the tree levels near the root, while values near one give nearly equal proportions of space to all tree levels.</para><para>The user may also specify an array to use to indicate the distance from the root, either vertically (for standard layout) or radially (for radial layout). You specify this with SetDistanceArrayName().</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkTreeLayoutStrategy, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkTreeLayoutStrategy
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
