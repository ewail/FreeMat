<para>Octree nodes serve as spatial sub-division primitives to build the search structure of an incremental octree in a recursive top-down manner. The hierarchy takes the form of a tree-like representation by which a parent node contains eight mutually non-overlapping child nodes. Each child is assigned with an axis-aligned rectangular volume (Spatial Bounding Box) and the eight children together cover exactly the same region as governed by their parent. The eight child nodes / octants are ordered as</para><para>{ (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] &amp; (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] &amp; (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] }, { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] &amp; (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] &amp; (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] }, { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] &amp; (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] &amp; (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] }, { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] &amp; (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] &amp; (zBBoxMin, zBBoxMid] }, { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] &amp; (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] &amp; (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] }, { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] &amp; (yBBoxMin, yBBoxMid] &amp; (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] }, { (xBBoxMin, xBBoxMid] &amp; (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] &amp; (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] }, { (xBBoxMid, xBBoxMax] &amp; (yBBoxMid, yBBoxMax] &amp; (zBBoxMid, zBBoxMax] },</para><para>where { xrange &amp; yRange &amp; zRange } defines the region of each 3D octant. In addition, the points falling within and registered, by means of point indices, in the parent node are distributed to the child nodes for delegated maintenance. In fact, only leaf nodes, i.e., those without any descendants, actually store point indices while each node, regardless of a leaf or non- leaf node, keeps a dynamically updated Data Bounding Box of the inhabitant points, if any. Given a maximum number of points per leaf node, an octree is initialized with an empty leaf node that is then recursively sub-divided, but only on demand as points are incrementally inserted, to construct a populated tree.</para><para>Please note that this octree node class is able to handle a large number of EXACTLY duplicate points that is greater than the specified maximum number of points per leaf node. In other words, as an exception, a leaf node may maintain an arbitrary number of exactly duplicate points to deal with possible extreme cases.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkIncrementalOctreeNode, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkIncrementalOctreeNode
