<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkBranchExtentTranslator is like extent translator, but it uses an alternative source as a whole extent. The whole extent passed is assumed to be a subextent of the original source. we simply take the intersection of the split extent and the whole extdent passed in. We are attempting to make branching pipelines request consistent extents with the same piece requests.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkBranchExtentTranslator, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkBranchExtentTranslator
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
