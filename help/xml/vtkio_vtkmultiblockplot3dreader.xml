<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader is a reader object that reads PLOT3D formatted files and generates structured grid(s) on output. PLOT3D is a computer graphics program designed to visualize the grids and solutions of computational fluid dynamics. Please see the &quot;PLOT3D User&apos;s Manual&quot; available from NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field CA.</para><para>PLOT3D files consist of a grid file (also known as XYZ file), an optional solution file (also known as a Q file), and an optional function file that contains user created data (currently unsupported). The Q file contains solution information as follows: the four parameters free stream mach number (Fsmach), angle of attack (Alpha), Reynolds number (Re), and total integration time (Time). This information is stored in an array called Properties in the FieldData of each output (tuple 0: fsmach, tuple 1: alpha, tuple 2: re, tuple 3: time). In addition, the solution file contains the flow density (scalar), flow momentum (vector), and flow energy (scalar).</para><para>The reader can generate additional scalars and vectors (or &quot;functions&quot;) from this information. To use vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader, you must specify the particular function number for the scalar and vector you want to visualize. This implementation of the reader provides the following functions. The scalar functions are: -1 - don&apos;t read or compute any scalars 100 - density 110 - pressure 120 - temperature 130 - enthalpy 140 - internal energy 144 - kinetic energy 153 - velocity magnitude 163 - stagnation energy 170 - entropy 184 - swirl.</para><para>The vector functions are: -1 - don&apos;t read or compute any vectors 200 - velocity 201 - vorticity 202 - momentum 210 - pressure gradient.</para><para>(Other functions are described in the PLOT3D spec, but only those listed are implemented here.) Note that by default, this reader creates the density scalar (100) and momentum vector (202) as output. (These are just read in from the solution file.) Please note that the validity of computation is a function of this class&apos;s gas constants (R, Gamma) and the equations used. They may not be suitable for your computational domain.</para><para>Additionally, you can read other data and associate it as a vtkDataArray into the output&apos;s point attribute data. Use the method AddFunction() to list all the functions that you&apos;d like to read. AddFunction() accepts an integer parameter that defines the function number.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkMultiBlockPLOT3DReader
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
