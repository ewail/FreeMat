<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkVolumeTextureMapper2D has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkVolumeTextureMapper2D class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetTargetTextureSize (int , int )</computeroutput> - Target size in pixels of each size of the texture for downloading. Default is 512x512 - so a 512x512 texture will be tiled with as many slices of the volume as possible, then all the quads will be rendered. This can be set to optimize for a particular architecture. This must be set with numbers that are a power of two.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetMaximumNumberOfPlanes (int )</computeroutput> - This is the maximum number of planes that will be created for texture mapping the volume. If the volume has more voxels than this along the viewing direction, then planes of the volume will be skipped to ensure that this maximum is not violated. A skip factor is used, and is incremented until the maximum condition is satisfied.  </para></listitem>
