<para>This class is a concrete representation for the vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2. It represents an infinite plane defined by a normal and point in the context of a bounding box. Through interaction with the widget, the plane can be manipulated by adjusting the plane normal or moving the origin point.</para><para>To use this representation, you normally define a (plane) origin and (plane) normal. The PlaceWidget() method is also used to intially position the representation.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
