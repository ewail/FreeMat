<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class represents a single spatial region in a 3D axis octant partitioning. It is intended to work efficiently with the vtkOctreePointLocator and is not meant for general use. It is assumed the region bounds some set of points. The ordering of the children is (-x,-y,-z),(+x,-y,-z),(-x,+y,-z),(+x,+y,-z),(-x,-y,+z),(+x,-y,+z), (-x,+y,+z),(+x,+y,+z). The portion of the domain assigned to an octant is Min &lt; x &lt;= Max.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkOctreePointLocatorNode, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkOctreePointLocatorNode
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
