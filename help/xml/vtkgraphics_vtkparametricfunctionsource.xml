SCALAR_QUADRANT, the scalar is set to 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending upon the quadrant of the point (u,v). SCALAR_X, the scalar is set to the x-value. SCALAR_Y, the scalar is set to the y-value. SCALAR_Z, the scalar is set to the z-value. SCALAR_DISTANCE, the scalar is set to (sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)). I.e. distance from the origin. SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED, the scalar is set to the value returned from EvaluateScalar().  </para></listitem>
