<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkVolumePicker is a subclass of vtkCellPicker. It has one advantage over vtkCellPicker for volumes: it will be able to correctly perform picking when CroppingPlanes are present. This isn&apos;t possible for vtkCellPicker since it doesn&apos;t link to the VolumeRendering classes and hence cannot access information about the CroppingPlanes.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkVolumePicker, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkVolumePicker
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkVolumePicker has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkVolumePicker class. <itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetPickCroppingPlanes (int )</computeroutput> - Set whether to pick the cropping planes of props that have them. If this is set, then the pick will be done on the cropping planes rather than on the data. The GetCroppingPlaneId() method will return the index of the cropping plane of the volume that was picked. This setting is only relevant to the picking of volumes.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.PickCroppingPlanesOn ()</computeroutput> - Set whether to pick the cropping planes of props that have them. If this is set, then the pick will be done on the cropping planes rather than on the data. The GetCroppingPlaneId() method will return the index of the cropping plane of the volume that was picked. This setting is only relevant to the picking of volumes.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>int = obj.GetCroppingPlaneId ()</computeroutput> - Get the index of the cropping plane that the pick ray passed through on its way to the prop. This will be set regardless of whether PickCroppingPlanes is on. The crop planes are ordered as follows: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax. If the volume is not cropped, the value will bet set to -1.  </para></listitem>
