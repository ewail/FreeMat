<para>Define a GL Node. A GL Node is an object that can be displayed in a GL Window. It is defined by a triangular mesh of vertices. It must also have a material that defines its appearance (i.e. color, shininess, etc.). The syntax for the <computeroutput>glnode</computeroutput> command is <verbatim>  glnode(name,material,pointset)  
</verbatim> where <computeroutput>material</computeroutput> is the name of a material that has already been defined with <computeroutput>gldefmaterial</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>pointset</computeroutput> is a <computeroutput>3 x N</computeroutput> matrix of points that define the geometry of the object. Note that the points are assumed to be connected in triangular facts, with the points defined counter clock-wise as seen from the outside of the facet. <computeroutput>FreeMat</computeroutput> will compute the normals. The <computeroutput>name</computeroutput> argument must be unique. If you want multiple instances of a given <computeroutput>glnode</computeroutput> in your GLWindow, that is fine, as instances of a <computeroutput>glnode</computeroutput> are created through a <computeroutput>glassembly</computeroutput>. </para></sect1>
