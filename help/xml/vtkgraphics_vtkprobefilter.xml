<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkProbeFilter is a filter that computes point attributes (e.g., scalars, vectors, etc.) at specified point positions. The filter has two inputs: the Input and Source. The Input geometric structure is passed through the filter. The point attributes are computed at the Input point positions by interpolating into the source data. For example, we can compute data values on a plane (plane specified as Input) from a volume (Source). The cell data of the source data is copied to the output based on in which source cell each input point is. If an array of the same name exists both in source&apos;s point and cell data, only the one from the point data is probed.</para><para>This filter can be used to resample data, or convert one dataset form into another. For example, an unstructured grid (vtkUnstructuredGrid) can be probed with a volume (three-dimensional vtkImageData), and then volume rendering techniques can be used to visualize the results. Another example: a line or curve can be used to probe data to produce x-y plots along that line or curve.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkProbeFilter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkProbeFilter
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkProbeFilter has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkProbeFilter class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetSpatialMatch (int )</computeroutput> - This flag is used only when a piece is requested to update. By default the flag is off. Because no spatial correspondence between input pieces and source pieces is known, all of the source has to be requested no matter what piece of the output is requested. When there is a spatial correspondence, the user/application can set this flag. This hint allows the breakup of the probe operation to be much more efficient. When piece m of n is requested for update by the user, then only n of m needs to be requested of the source.  </para></listitem>
