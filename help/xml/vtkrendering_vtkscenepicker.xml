<title>Usage</title>
<para>The Scene picker, unline conventional pickers picks an entire viewport at one shot and caches the result, which can be retrieved later. The utility of the class arises during <bold>Actor Selection</bold>. Let&apos;s say you have a couple of polygonal objects in your scene and you wish to have a status bar that indicates the object your mouse is over. Picking repeatedly every time your mouse moves would be very slow. The scene picker automatically picks your viewport every time the camera is changed and caches the information. Additionally, it observes the vtkRenderWindowInteractor to avoid picking during interaction, so that you still maintain your interactivity. In effect, the picker does an additional pick-render of your scene every time you stop interacting with your scene. As an example, see Rendering/TestScenePicker.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkScenePicker, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkScenePicker
