<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class is used to define the API for, and partially implement, a representation for different types of widgets. Note that the widget representation (i.e., subclasses of vtkWidgetRepresentation) are a type of vtkProp; meaning that they can be associated with a vtkRenderer end embedded in a scene like any other vtkActor. However, vtkWidgetRepresentation also defines an API that enables it to be paired with a subclass vtkAbstractWidget, meaning that it can be driven by a widget, serving to represent the widget as the widget responds to registered events.</para><para>The API defined here should be regarded as a guideline for implementing widgets and widget representations. Widget behavior is complex, as is the way the representation responds to the registered widget events, so the API may vary from widget to widget to reflect this complexity.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkWidgetRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkWidgetRepresentation
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<para><computeroutput>obj.PlaceWidget (double )</computeroutput> - The following is a suggested API for widget representations. These methods define the communication between the widget and its representation. These methods are only suggestions because widgets take on so many different forms that a universal API is not deemed practical. However, these methods should be implemented when possible to insure that the VTK widget hierarchy remains self-consistent. <preformatted>
 PlaceWidget() - given a bounding box (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax), place 
                 the widget inside of it. The current orientation of the widget 
                 is preserved, only scaling and translation is performed.
 StartWidgetInteraction() - generally corresponds to a initial event (e.g.,
                            mouse down) that starts the interaction process
                            with the widget.
 WidgetInteraction() - invoked when an event causes the widget to change 
                       appearance.
 EndWidgetInteraction() - generally corresponds to a final event (e.g., mouse up)
                          and completes the interaction sequence.
 ComputeInteractionState() - given (X,Y) display coordinates in a renderer, with a
                             possible flag that modifies the computation,
                             what is the state of the widget?
 GetInteractionState() - return the current state of the widget. Note that the
                         value of &quot;0&quot; typically refers to &quot;outside&quot;. The 
                         interaction state is strictly a function of the
                         representation, and the widget/represent must agree
                         on what they mean.
 Highlight() - turn on or off any highlights associated with the widget.
               Highlights are generally turned on when the widget is selected.

<para><computeroutput>int = obj.RenderVolumetricGeometry (vtkViewport )</computeroutput> - Methods to make this class behave as a vtkProp. They are repeated here (from the vtkProp superclass) as a reminder to the widget implementor. Failure to implement these methods properly may result in the representation not appearing in the scene (i.e., not implementing the Render() methods properly) or leaking graphics resources (i.e., not implementing ReleaseGraphicsResources() properly).  </para></listitem>
