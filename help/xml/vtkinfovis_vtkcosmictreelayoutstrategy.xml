<title>Usage</title>
<para>This layout strategy takes an input tree and places all the children of a node into a containing circle. The placement is such that each child placed can be represented with a circle tangent to the containing circle and (usually) 2 other children. The interior of the circle is left empty so that graph edges drawn on top of the tree will not obfuscate the tree. However, when one child is much larger than all the others, it may encroach on the center of the containing circle; that&apos;s OK, because it&apos;s large enough not to be obscured by edges drawn atop it.</para><para>.SECTION Thanks Thanks to the galaxy and David Thompson hierarchically nested inside it for inspiring this layout strategy.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkCosmicTreeLayoutStrategy, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkCosmicTreeLayoutStrategy

<para>The class vtkCosmicTreeLayoutStrategy has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
