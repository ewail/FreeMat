<title>Usage</title>
<para>The <computeroutput>wavwrite</computeroutput> funtion writes an audio signal to a linear PCM WAV file. The simplest form for its use is <verbatim>    wavwrite(y,filename)
</verbatim> which writes the data stored in <computeroutput>y</computeroutput> to a WAV file with the name <computeroutput>filename</computeroutput>. By default, the output data is assumed to be sampled at a rate of 8 KHz, and is output using 16 bit integer format. Each column of <computeroutput>y</computeroutput> is written as a separate channel. The data are clipped to the range <computeroutput>[-1,1]</computeroutput> prior to writing them out. If you want the data to be written with a different sampling frequency, you can use the following form of the <computeroutput>wavwrite</computeroutput> command: <verbatim>   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,filename)
</verbatim> where <computeroutput>SampleRate</computeroutput> is in Hz. Finally, you can specify the number of bits to use in the output form of the file using the form <verbatim>   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,NBits,filename)
</verbatim> where <computeroutput>NBits</computeroutput> is the number of bits to use. Legal values include <computeroutput>8,16,24,32</computeroutput>. For less than 32 bit output format, the data is truncated to the range <computeroutput>[-1,1]</computeroutput>, and an integer output format is used (type 1 PCM in WAV-speak). For 32 bit output format, the data is written in type 3 PCM as floating point data. </para></sect1>
