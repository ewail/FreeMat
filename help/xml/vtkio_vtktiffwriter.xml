<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkTIFFWriter writes image data as a TIFF data file. Data can be written uncompressed or compressed. Several forms of compression are supported including packed bits, JPEG, deflation, and LZW. (Note: LZW compression is currently under patent in the US and is disabled until the patent expires. However, the mechanism for supporting this compression is available for those with a valid license or to whom the patent does not apply.)</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkTIFFWriter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkTIFFWriter
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
