<para><computeroutput>int = obj.IntersectWithLine (double p1[3], double p2[3], vtkPoints points, vtkIdList cellIds)</computeroutput> - Take the passed line segment and intersect it with the data set. This method assumes that the data set is a vtkPolyData that describes a closed surface, and the intersection points that are returned in &apos;points&apos; alternate between entrance points and exit points. The return value of the function is 0 if no intersections were found, -1 if point &apos;a0&apos; lies inside the closed surface, or +1 if point &apos;a0&apos; lies outside the closed surface. Either &apos;points&apos; or &apos;cellIds&apos; can be set to NULL if you don&apos;t want to receive that information. This method is currently only implemented in vtkOBBTree  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.FindCellsWithinBounds (double bbox, vtkIdList cells)</computeroutput> - Return a list of unique cell ids inside of a given bounding box. The user must provide the vtkIdList to populate. This method returns data only after the locator has been built.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkIdType = obj.FindCell (double x[3])</computeroutput> - Returns the Id of the cell containing the point, returns -1 if no cell found. This interface uses a tolerance of zero  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>vtkIdType = obj.FindCell (double x[3], double tol2, vtkGenericCell GenCell, double pcoords[3], double weights)</computeroutput> - Find the cell containing a given point. returns -1 if no cell found the cell parameters are copied into the supplied variables, a cell must be provided to store the information.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>bool = obj.InsideCellBounds (double x[3], vtkIdType cell_ID)</computeroutput> - Quickly test if a point is inside the bounds of a particular cell. Some locators cache cell bounds and this function can make use of fast access to the data.  </para></listitem>
