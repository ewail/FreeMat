<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkSurfaceLICPainter painter performs LIC on the surface of arbitrary geometry. Point vectors are used as the vector field for generating the LIC. The implementation is based on &quot;Image Space Based Visualization on Unstread
  Flow on Surfaces&quot; by Laramee, Jobard and Hauser appered in proceedings of IEEE Visualization &apos;03, pages 131-138.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkSurfaceLICPainter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkSurfaceLICPainter

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkSurfaceLICPainter has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkSurfaceLICPainter class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</computeroutput> - Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this mapper. The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic resources to release. In this case, releases the display lists.  </para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>vtkDataObject = obj.GetOutput ()</computeroutput> - Get the output data object from this painter. Overridden to pass the input points (or cells) vectors as the tcoords to the deletage painters. This is required by the internal GLSL shader programs used for generating LIC.  </para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetInputArrayToProcess (int fieldAssociation, string name)</computeroutput> - Set the vectors to used for applying LIC. By default point vectors are used. Arguments are same as those passed to vtkAlgorithm::SetInputArrayToProcess except the first 3 arguments i.e. idx, port, connection.  </para></listitem>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetInputArrayToProcess (int fieldAssociation, int fieldAttributeType)</computeroutput> - Set the vectors to used for applying LIC. By default point vectors are used.

<listitem>
<para><computeroutput>obj.SetEnhancedLIC (int )</computeroutput> - Enable/Disable enhanced LIC that improves image quality by increasing inter-streamline contrast while suppressing artifacts. Enhanced LIC performs two passes of LIC, with a 3x3 Laplacian high-pass filter in between that processes the output of pass #1 LIC and forwards the result as the input &apos;noise&apos; to pass #2 LIC. This flag is automatically turned off during user interaction.  </para></listitem>
