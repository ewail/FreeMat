<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class resorts to GLSL to implement GPU-based Line Integral Convolution (LIC) for visualizing a 2D vector field that may be obtained by projecting an original 3D vector field onto a surface (such that the resulting 2D vector at each grid point on the surface is tangential to the local normal, as done in vtkSurfaceLICPainter).</para><para>As an image-based technique, 2D LIC works by (1) integrating a bidirectional streamline from the center of each pixel (of the LIC output image), (2) locating the pixels along / hit by this streamline as the correlated pixels of the starting pixel (seed point / pixel), (3) indexing a (usually white) noise texture (another input to LIC, in addition to the 2D vector field, usually with the same size as that of the 2D vetor field) to determine the values (colors) of these pixels (the starting and the correlated pixels), typically through bi-linear interpolation, and (4) performing convolution (weighted averaging) on these values, by adopting a low-pass filter (such as box, ramp, and Hanning kernels), to obtain the result value (color) that is then assigned to the seed pixel.</para><para>The GLSL-based GPU implementation herein maps the aforementioned pipeline to fragment shaders and a box kernel is employed. Both the white noise and the vector field are provided to the GPU as texture objects (supported by the multi-texturing capability). In addition, there are four texture objects (color buffers) allocated to constitute two pairs that work in a ping-pong fashion, with one as the read buffers and the other as the write / render targets. Maintained by a frame buffer object (GL_EXT_framebuffer_object), each pair employs one buffer to store the current (dynamically updated) position (by means of the texture coordinate that keeps being warped by the underlying vector) of the (virtual) particle initially released from each fragment while using the bother buffer to store the current (dynamically updated too) accumulated texture value that each seed fragment (before the &apos;mesh&apos; is warped) collects. Given NumberOfSteps integration steps in each direction, there are a total of (2 * NumberOfSteps + 1) fragments (including the seed fragment) are convolved and each contributes 1 / (2 * NumberOfSteps<itemizedlist>

</para><para>One pass of LIC (basic LIC) tends to produce low-contrast / blurred images and vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D provides an option for creating enhanced LIC images. Enhanced LIC improves image quality by increasing inter-streamline contrast while suppressing artifacts. It performs two passes of LIC, with a 3x3 Laplacian high-pass filter in between that processes the output of pass #1 LIC and forwards the result as the input &apos;noise&apos; to pass #2 LIC. Enhanced LIC automatically degenerates to basic LIC during user interaction.</para><para>vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D applies masking to zero-vector fragments so that un-filtered white noise areas are made totally transparent by class vtkSurfaceLICPainter to show the underlying geometry surface.</para><para>.SECTION Required OpenGL Extensins GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two GL_VERSION_2_0 GL_ARB_texture_float GL_ARB_draw_buffers GL_EXT_framebuffer_object</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkLineIntegralConvolution2D
