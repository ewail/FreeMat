<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter is an class that maps a data object (i.e., a field) into a concrete dataset, i.e., gives structure to the field by defining a geometry and topology.</para><para>To use this filter you associate components in the input field data with portions of the output dataset. (A component is an array of values from the field.) For example, you would specify x-y-z points by assigning components from the field for the x, then y, then z values of the points. You may also have to specify component ranges (for each z-y-z) to make sure that the number of x, y, and z values is the same. Also, you may want to normalize the components which helps distribute the data uniformly. Once you&apos;ve setup the filter to combine all the pieces of data into a specified dataset (the geometry, topology, point and cell data attributes), the various output methods (e.g., GetPolyData()) are used to retrieve the final product.</para><para>This filter is often used in conjunction with vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter. vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter takes field data and transforms it into attribute data (e.g., point and cell data attributes such as scalars and vectors). To do this, use this filter which constructs a concrete dataset and passes the input data object field data to its output. and then use vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter to generate the attribute data associated with the dataset.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<para><computeroutput>int = obj.GetCellConnectivityComponentMinRange ()</computeroutput> - Define cell types and cell connectivity when creating unstructured grid data. These methods are similar to those for defining points, except that no normalization of the data is possible. Basically, you need to define an array of cell types (an integer value per cell), and another array consisting (for each cell) of a number of points per cell, and then the cell connectivity.
