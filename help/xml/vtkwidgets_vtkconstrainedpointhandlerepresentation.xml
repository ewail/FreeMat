<title>Usage</title>
<para>This class is used to represent a vtkHandleWidget. It represents a position in 3D world coordinates that is constrained to a specified plane. The default look is to draw a white point when this widget is not selected or active, a thin green circle when it is highlighted, and a thicker cyan circle when it is active (being positioned). Defaults can be adjusted - but take care to define cursor geometry that makes sense for this widget. The geometry will be aligned on the constraining plane, with the plane normal aligned with the X axis of the geometry (similar behavior to vtkGlyph3D).</para><para>TODO: still need to work on 1) translation when mouse is outside bounding planes 2) size of the widget</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation
