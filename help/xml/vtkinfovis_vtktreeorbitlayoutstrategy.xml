<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkTreeOrbitLayoutStrategy class. <itemizedlist>
