<title>Usage</title>
<para>vtkDashedStreamLine is a filter that generates a &quot;dashed&quot; streamline for an arbitrary dataset. The streamline consists of a series of dashes, each of which represents (approximately) a constant time increment. Thus, in the resulting visual representation, relatively long dashes represent areas of high velocity, and small dashes represent areas of low velocity.</para><para>vtkDashedStreamLine introduces the instance variable DashFactor. DashFactor interacts with its superclass&apos; instance variable StepLength to create the dashes. DashFactor is the percentage of the StepLength line segment that is visible. Thus, if the DashFactor=0.75, the dashes will be &quot;three-quarters on&quot; and &quot;one-quarter off&quot;.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkDashedStreamLine, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkDashedStreamLine
</verbatim> </para></sect1>
