<para>This filter has code to collect a graph from across processes onto vertex 0. Collection can be turned on or off using the &quot;PassThrough&quot; flag.</para><para>To create an instance of class vtkCollectGraph, simply invoke its constructor as follows <verbatim>  obj = vtkCollectGraph
</verbatim> </para></sect1>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>The class vtkCollectGraph has several methods that can be used. They are listed below. Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources, and may not be completely intelligible. When in doubt, consult the VTK website. In the methods listed below, <computeroutput>obj</computeroutput> is an instance of the vtkCollectGraph class. <itemizedlist>

<para><computeroutput>obj.SetOutputType (int )</computeroutput> - Directedness flag, used to signal whether the output graph is directed or undirected. DIRECTED_OUTPUT expects that this filter is generating a directed graph. UNDIRECTED_OUTPUT expects that this filter is generating an undirected graph. DIRECTED_OUTPUT and UNDIRECTED_OUTPUT flags should only be set on the client filter. Server filters should be set to USE_INPUT_TYPE since they have valid input and the directedness is determined from the input type.  </para></listitem>
