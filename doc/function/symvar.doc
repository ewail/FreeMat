\page function_symvar SYMVAR Find Symbolic Variables in an Expression

<p>
Section: \ref sec_function "Function Related Functions"
\section Usage
Finds the symbolic variables in an expression.  The syntax for its
use is 
\verbatim
  syms = symvar(expr)
\endverbatim
where <tt>expr</tt> is a string containing an expression, such as
<tt>'x^2 + cos(t+alpha)'</tt>.  The result is a cell array of strings
containing the non-function identifiers in the expression.  Because
they are usually not used as identifiers in expressions, the strings
 <tt>'pi','inf','nan','eps','i','j'</tt> are ignored.
\section Example
Here are some simple examples:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_function_symvar_000.m
0
symvar('x^2+sqrt(x)')  % sqrt is eliminated as a function
symvar('pi+3')         % No identifiers here
symvar('x + t*alpha')  % x, t and alpha
\endif


\verbinclude frag_function_symvar_000.m.out
