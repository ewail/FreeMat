\page os_mkdir MKDIR Make Directory

<p>
Section: \ref sec_os "Operating System Functions"
\section Usage
Creates a directory.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  mkdir('dirname')
\endverbatim
which creates the directory <tt>dirname</tt> if it does not exist.  The argument
<tt>dirname</tt> can be either a relative path or an absolute path.  For compatibility
with MATLAB, the following syntax is also allowed
\verbatim
  mkdir('parentdir','dirname')
\endverbatim
which attempts to create a directory <tt>dirname</tt> in the directory given by <tt>parentdir</tt>.
However, this simply calls <tt>mkdir([parentdir dirsep dirname])</tt>, and if this is not
the required behavior, please file an enhancement request to have it changed.  Note that
<tt>mkdir</tt> returns a logical <tt>1</tt> if the call succeeded, and a logical <tt>0</tt> if not.
