\section Usage
Copies a file or files from one location to another.  There are 
several syntaxes for this function that are acceptable:
\verbatim
   copyfile(file_in,file_out)
\endverbatim
copies the file from <tt>file_in</tt> to <tt>file_out</tt>.  Also, the second
argument can be a directory name:
\verbatim
   copyfile(file_in,directory_out)
\endverbatim
in which case <tt>file_in</tt> is copied into the directory specified by
<tt>directory_out</tt>.  You can also use <tt>copyfile</tt> to copy entire directories
as in
\verbatim
   copyfile(dir_in,dir_out)
\endverbatim
in which case the directory contents are copied to the destination directory
(which is created if necessary).  Finally, the first argument to <tt>copyfile</tt> can
contain wildcards
\verbatim
   copyfile(pattern,directory_out)
\endverbatim
in which case all files that match the given pattern are copied to the output
directory.   Note that to remain compatible with the MATLAB API, this function
will delete/replace destination files that already exist, unless they are marked
as read-only.  If you want to force the copy to succeed, you can append a <tt>'f'</tt>
argument to the <tt>copyfile</tt> function:
\verbatim
   copyfile(arg1,arg2,'f')
\endverbatim
or equivalently
\verbatim
   copyfile arg1 arg2 f
\endverbatim
