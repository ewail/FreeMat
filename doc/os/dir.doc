\page os_dir DIR List Files Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_os "Operating System Functions"
\section Usage
In some versions of FreeMat (pre 3.1), the <tt>dir</tt> function was aliased
to the <tt>ls</tt> function.  Starting with version <tt>3.1</tt>, the <tt>dir</tt> function
has been rewritten to provide compatibility with MATLAB.  The general syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
  dir
\endverbatim
in which case, a listing of the files in the current directory are output to the
console.  Alternately, you can specify a target via
\verbatim
  dir('name')
\endverbatim
or using the string syntax
\verbatim
  dir name
\endverbatim
If you want to capture the output of the <tt>dir</tt> command, you can assign the output
to an array
\verbatim
  result = dir('name')
\endverbatim
(or you can omit <tt>'name'</tt> to get a directory listing of the current directory.  The
resulting array <tt>result</tt> is a structure array containing the fields:
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>name</tt> the filename as a string
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>date</tt> the modification date and time stamp as a string
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>bytes</tt> the size of the file in bytes as a <tt>uint64</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>isdir</tt> a logical that is <tt>1</tt> if the file corresponds to a directory.
 </LI>
</UL>
Note that <tt>'name'</tt> can also contain wildcards (e.g., <tt>dir *.m</tt> to get a listing of
all FreeMat scripts in the current directory.
