\page os_cd CD Change Working Directory Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_os "Operating System Functions"
\section Usage
Changes the current working directory to the one specified as the argument.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  cd('dirname')
\endverbatim
but this can also be expressed as
\verbatim
  cd 'dirname'
\endverbatim
or 
\verbatim
  cd dirname
\endverbatim
Examples of all three usages are given below.
Generally speaking, <tt>dirname</tt> is any string that would be accepted 
by the underlying OS as a valid directory name.  For example, on most 
systems, <tt>'.'</tt> refers to the current directory, and <tt>'..'</tt> refers 
to the parent directory.  Also, depending on the OS, it may be necessary 
to ``escape'' the directory seperators.  In particular, if directories 
are seperated with the backwards-slash character <tt>'\\'</tt>, then the 
path specification must use double-slashes <tt>'\\\\'</tt>. Note: to get 
file-name completion to work at this time, you must use one of the 
first two forms of the command.

\section Example
The <tt>pwd</tt> command returns the current directory location.  First, 
we use the simplest form of the <tt>cd</tt> command, in which the directory 
name argument is given unquoted.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_os_cd_000.m
0
pwd
cd ..
pwd
\endif


\verbinclude frag_os_cd_000.m.out 

Next, we use the ``traditional'' form of the function call, using 
both the parenthesis and a variable to store the quoted string.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_os_cd_001.m
0
a = pwd;
cd(a)
pwd
\endif


\verbinclude frag_os_cd_001.m.out
