\section Usage
A script is a sequence of FreeMat commands contained in a
<tt>.m</tt> file.  When the script is called (via the name of the
file), the effect is the same as if the commands inside the
script file were issued one at a time from the keyboard.
Unlike <tt>function</tt> files (which have the same extension,
but have a <tt>function</tt> declaration), script files share
the same environment as their callers.  Hence, assignments,
etc, made inside a script are visible to the caller (which
is not the case for functions.
\section Example
Here is an example of a script that makes some simple
assignments and <tt>printf</tt> statements.

\if FILE
tscript.m
a = 13;
printf('a is %d\n',a);
b = a + 32
\endif
\verbatim
     tscript.m
\endverbatim

\verbinclude tscript.m

If we execute the script and then look at the defined variables

\if FRAGMENT
frag_functions_script_000.m
0
tscript
who
\endif


\verbinclude frag_functions_script_000.m.out 

we see that <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are defined appropriately.
