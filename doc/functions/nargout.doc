\page functions_nargout NARGOUT Number of Output Arguments

<p>
Section: \ref sec_functions "Functions and Scripts"
\section Usage
The <tt>nargout</tt> function computes the number of return values requested from
a function when it was called.  The general syntax for its use
\verbatim
   y = nargout
\endverbatim
FreeMat allows for
fewer return values to be requested from a function than were declared,
and <tt>nargout</tt> can be used to determine exactly what subset of 
the functions outputs are required.  

You can also use <tt>nargout</tt> on a function handle to return the
number of input arguments expected by the function
\verbatim
  y = nargout(fun)
\endverbatim
where <tt>fun</tt> is the name of the function (e.g. <tt>'sin'</tt>) or 
a function handle.
\section Example
Here is a function that is declared to return five 
values, and that simply prints the value of <tt>nargout</tt>
each time it is called.

\if FILE
nargouttest.m
function [a1,a2,a3,a4,a5] = nargouttest
  printf('nargout = %d\n',nargout);
  a1 = 1; a2 = 2; a3 = 3; a4 = 4; a5 = 5;
\endif
\verbatim
     nargouttest.m
\endverbatim

\verbinclude nargouttest.m


\if FRAGMENT
frag_functions_nargout_000.m
0
a1 = nargouttest
[a1,a2] = nargouttest
[a1,a2,a3] = nargouttest
[a1,a2,a3,a4,a5] = nargouttest
nargout('sin')
y = @sin
nargout(y)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_functions_nargout_000.m.out
