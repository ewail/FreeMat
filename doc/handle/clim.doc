\page handle_clim CLIM Adjust Color limits of plot

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
There are several ways to use <tt>clim</tt> to adjust the color limits of
a plot.  The various syntaxes are
\verbatim
   clim
   clim([lo,hi])   
   clim('auto')
   clim('manual')
   clim('mode')
   clim(handle,...)
\endverbatim
The first form (without arguments), returns a 2-vector containing the
current limits.  The second form sets the limits on the plot to <tt>[lo,hi]</tt>.
The third and fourth form set the mode for the limit to <tt>auto</tt> and <tt>manual</tt>
respectively.  In <tt>auto</tt> mode, FreeMat chooses the range for the axis 
automatically.  The <tt>clim('mode')</tt> form returns the current mode for the axis
(either <tt>'auto'</tt> or <tt>'manual'</tt>).  

Switching to <tt>manual</tt> mode does not change the limits, it simply allows
 you to modify them (and disables the automatic adjustment of the limits
as more objects are added to the plot).  Also, if you specify a set of 
limits explicitly, the mode is set to <tt>manual</tt>
 
Finally, you can specify the handle of an
axis to manipulate instead of using the current one.
\section Example
Here is an example of using <tt>clim</tt> to change the effective window and
level onto an image.  First, the image with default
limits

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_clim_000.m
0
x = repmat(linspace(-1,1),[100,1]); y = x';
z = exp(-x.^2-y.^2);
image(z);
min(z(:))
max(z(:))
mprint clim1
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_clim_000.m.out 

which results in
\image html clim1.png
\image latex clim1.eps "clim1" width=12cm
Next, we change the colorscale of the image using the
 <tt>clim</tt> function

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_clim_001.m
0
image(z);
clim([0,0.2]);
mprint clim2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_clim_001.m.out 

which results in
\image html clim2.png
\image latex clim2.eps "clim2" width=12cm
