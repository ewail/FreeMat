\page handle_loglog LOGLOG Log-Log Plot Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
This command has the exact same syntax as the <tt>plot</tt> command:
\verbatim
  loglog(<data 1>,{linespec 1},<data 2>,{linespec 2}...,properties...)
\endverbatim
in fact, it is a simple wrapper around <tt>plot</tt> that sets the
x and y axis to have a logarithmic scale.
\section Example
Here is an example of a doubly exponential signal plotted first on a linear
plot:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_loglog_000.m
0
x = linspace(1,100);
y = x;
plot(x,y,'r-');
mprint loglog1
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_loglog_000.m.out 

\image html loglog1.png
\image latex loglog1.eps "loglog1" width=12cm
and now on a log-log plot

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_loglog_001.m
0
loglog(x,y,'r-');
mprint loglog2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_loglog_001.m.out 

\image html loglog2.png
\image latex loglog2.eps "loglog2" width=12cm
