\section Usage

window with a specific handle, or all figure windows.  The general

closed.  Alternately, issuing the command with no argument
\verbatim
   close
\endverbatim
is equivalent to closing the currently active figure window.  Finally
the command
\verbatim
   close('all')
\endverbatim
closes all figure windows currently open.
