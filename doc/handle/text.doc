\page handle_text TEXT Add Text Label to Plot

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
Adds a text label to the currently active plot.  The general
syntax for it is use is either
\verbatim
   text(x,y,'label')
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are both vectors of the same length, in which
case the text <tt>'label'</tt> is added to the current plot at each of the
coordinates <tt>x(i),y(i)</tt> (using the current axis to map these to screen
coordinates).  The second form supplies a cell-array of strings
as the second argument, and allows you to place many labels simultaneously
\verbatim
   text(x,y,{'label1','label2',....})
\endverbatim
where the number of elements in the cell array must match the size of
vectors <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  You can also specify properties for the labels
via
\verbatim
   handles = text(x,y,{labels},properties...)
\endverbatim
\section Example
Here is an example of a few labels being added to a random plot:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_text_000.m
0
plot(rand(1,4))
text([2,3],[0.5,0.5],{'hello','there'})
mprint text1
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_text_000.m.out 

\image html text1.png
\image latex text1.eps "text1" width=12cm
Here is the same example, but with larger labels:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_text_001.m
0
plot(rand(1,4))
text([2,3],[0.5,0.5],{'hello','there'},'fontsize',20)
mprint text2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_text_001.m.out 

\image html text2.png
\image latex text2.eps "text2" width=12cm
