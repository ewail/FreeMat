\section Usage
 This function makes a zero-pole plot of a discrete-time
 system defined by its zeros and poles. The various syntaxes
 are
\verbatim
    zplane(z,p)
\endverbatim
 where <tt>z</tt> and <tt>p</tt> are the zeros and the poles of the system
 stored as column vectors, or
\verbatim
    zplane(b,a)
\endverbatim
 where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are the polynomial coefficients of the
 numerator and denominator stored as line vectors (<tt>roots</tt> is
 used to find the zeros and poles). The symbol <tt>'o'</tt> represents
 a zero and the symbol <tt>'x'</tt> represents a pole. The plot includes
 the unit circle for reference.
