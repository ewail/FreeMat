\page handle_xlim XLIM Adjust X Axis limits of plot

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
There are several ways to use <tt>xlim</tt> to adjust the X axis limits of
a plot.  The various syntaxes are
\verbatim
   xlim
   xlim([lo,hi])   
   xlim('auto')
   xlim('manual')
   xlim('mode')
   xlim(handle,...)
\endverbatim
The first form (without arguments), returns a 2-vector containing the
current limits.  The second form sets the limits on the plot to <tt>[lo,hi]</tt>.
The third and fourth form set the mode for the limit to <tt>auto</tt> and <tt>manual</tt>
respectively.  In <tt>auto</tt> mode, FreeMat chooses the range for the axis 
automatically.  The <tt>xlim('mode')</tt> form returns the current mode for the axis
(either <tt>'auto'</tt> or <tt>'manual'</tt>).  Finally, you can specify the handle of an
axis to manipulate instead of using the current one.

As an additional feature, you can now specify <tt>inf</tt> for a limit, and
FreeMat will take that limit from the automatic set.  So, for example 
<tt>xlim([10,inf])</tt> will set the minimum for the x axis, but use the
automatic value for the maximum.
\section Example

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_xlim_000.m
0
x = linspace(-1,1);
y = sin(2*pi*x);
plot(x,y,'r-');
xlim  % what are the current limits?
mprint xlim1
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_xlim_000.m.out 

which results in
\image html xlim1.png
\image latex xlim1.eps "xlim1" width=12cm
Next, we zoom in on the plot using the <tt>xlim</tt> function

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_xlim_001.m
0
plot(x,y,'r-')
xlim([-0.2,0.2])
mprint xlim2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_xlim_001.m.out 

which results in
\image html xlim2.png
\image latex xlim2.eps "xlim2" width=12cm
To demonstrate the infinite limits feature.  Consider the following

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_xlim_002.m
0
plot(x,y,'r-');
xlim([0,inf])
mprint xlim3
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_xlim_002.m.out 

which results in 
\image html xlim3.png
\image latex xlim3.eps "xlim3" width=12cm
