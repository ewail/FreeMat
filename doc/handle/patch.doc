\page handle_patch PATCH Patch Graphics Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
This routine is used to create a patch object that can be plotting 2D and 3D surfaces.  A 
patch is a polygon defined by the xyz coordinates
of its vertices and optionally by the color at the vertices.
There are several forms for the <tt>patch</tt> function:
\verbatim
  h = patch(X,Y,C,properties...)
  h = patch(X,Y,Z,C,properties...)
  h = patch(properties...)
  h = patch(V)
\endverbatim
Where <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt> and <tt>Z</tt> are matrices or vectors of <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> or <tt>z</tt> coordinates
and <tt>C</tt> is a matrix or vector of color values (the colormap
for the current fig is applied).  
\section Example
Here we generate a surface specifying all four components.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_patch_000.m

x = [ 0 1 0 1]';
y = [ 0 0 1 1]';
c = [ 1 1 1 ];
patch(x,y,c)
