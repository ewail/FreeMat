\page handle_zlim ZLIM Adjust Z Axis limits of plot

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
There are several ways to use <tt>zlim</tt> to adjust the Z axis limits of
a plot.  The various syntaxes are
\verbatim
   zlim
   zlim([lo,hi])   
   zlim('auto')
   zlim('manual')
   zlim('mode')
   zlim(handle,...)
\endverbatim
The first form (without arguments), returns a 2-vector containing the
current limits.  The second form sets the limits on the plot to <tt>[lo,hi]</tt>.
The third and fourth form set the mode for the limit to <tt>auto</tt> and <tt>manual</tt>
respectively.  In <tt>auto</tt> mode, FreeMat chooses the range for the axis 
automatically.  The <tt>zlim('mode')</tt> form returns the current mode for the axis
(either <tt>'auto'</tt> or <tt>'manual'</tt>).  Finally, you can specify the handle of an
axis to manipulate instead of using the current one.
