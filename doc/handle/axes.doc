\page handle_axes AXES Create Handle Axes

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
This function has three different syntaxes.  The first takes
no arguments,
\verbatim
  h = axes
\endverbatim
and creates a new set of axes that are parented to the current
figure (see <tt>gcf</tt>).  The newly created axes are made the current
axes (see <tt>gca</tt>) and are added to the end of the list of children 
for the current figure.
The second form takes a set of property names and values
\verbatim
  h = axes(propertyname,value,propertyname,value,...)
\endverbatim
Creates a new set of axes, and then sets the specified properties
to the given value.  This is a shortcut for calling 
<tt>set(h,propertyname,value)</tt> for each pair.
The third form takes a handle as an argument
\verbatim
  axes(handle)
\endverbatim
and makes <tt>handle</tt> the current axes, placing it at the head of
the list of children for the current figure.
