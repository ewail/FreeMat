\page handle_print PRINT Print a Figure To A File

<p>
Section: \ref sec_handle "Handle-Based Graphics"
\section Usage
This function ``prints'' the currently active fig to a file.  The 
generic syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  print(filename)
\endverbatim
or, alternately,
\verbatim
  print filename
\endverbatim
where <tt>filename</tt> is the (string) filename of the destined file.  The current
fig is then saved to the output file using a format that is determined
by the extension of the filename.  The exact output formats may vary on
different platforms, but generally speaking, the following extensions
should be supported cross-platform:
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>jpg</tt>, <tt>jpeg</tt>  --  JPEG file 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>pdf</tt> -- Portable Document Format file
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>png</tt> -- Portable Net Graphics file
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>svg</tt> -- Scalable Vector Graphics file
 </LI>
</UL>
Postscript (PS, EPS) is supported on non-Mac-OSX Unix only.
Note that only the fig is printed, not the window displaying
the fig.  If you want something like that (essentially a window-capture)
use a seperate utility or your operating system's built in screen
capture ability.
\section Example
Here is a simple example of how the figures in this manual are generated.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_handle_print_000.m
0
x = linspace(-1,1);
y = cos(5*pi*x);
plot(x,y,'r-');
print('printfig1.eps')
print('printfig1.jpg')
print('printfig1.png')
\endif


\verbinclude frag_handle_print_000.m.out 

which creates three plots <tt>printfig.eps</tt>, which is an Encapsulated PostScript
file, <tt>printfig1.png</tt>, which is a Portable
Net Graphics file, and <tt>printfig1.jpg</tt> which is a JPEG file.

\image latex printfig1.eps "printfig1" width=12cm
