\page mathfunctions_fix FIX Round Towards Zero

<p>
Section: \ref sec_mathfunctions "Mathematical Functions"
\section Usage
Rounds the argument array towards zero.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = fix(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is a numeric array.  For positive elements of <tt>x</tt>, the output
is the largest integer smaller than <tt>x</tt>.  For negative elements of <tt>x</tt>
the output is the smallest integer larger than <tt>x</tt>.  For complex <tt>x</tt>,
the operation is applied seperately to the real and imaginary parts.
\section Example
Here is a simple example of the <tt>fix</tt> operation on some values

\if FRAGMENT
frag_mathfunctions_fix_000.m
0
a = [-1.8,pi,8,-pi,-0.001,2.3+0.3i]
fix(a)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_mathfunctions_fix_000.m.out
