\section Usage
 vtkMath provides methods to perform common math operations. These 
 include providing constants such as Pi; conversion from degrees to 
 radians; vector operations such as dot and cross products and vector 
 norm; matrix determinant for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices; univariate polynomial
 solvers; and for random number generation (for backward compatibility only).

To create an instance of class vtkMath, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkMath
\endverbatim
