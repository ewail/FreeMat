Section: \ref sec_vtkcommon "Visualization Toolkit Common Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkSphericalTransform will convert (r,phi,theta) coordinates to 
 (x,y,z) coordinates and back again.  The angles are given in radians.
 By default, it converts spherical coordinates to rectangular, but
 GetInverse() returns a transform that will do the opposite.  The equation
 that is used is x = r*sin(phi)*cos(theta), y = r*sin(phi)*sin(theta),
 z = r*cos(phi).

To create an instance of class vtkSphericalTransform, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSphericalTransform
\endverbatim
