<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt> -  Return the class name as a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt> -  Return the class name as a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDirectory = obj.NewInstance ()</tt> -  Return the class name as a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDirectory = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt> -  Return the class name as a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.Open (string dir)</tt> -  Open the specified directory and load the names of the files
 in that directory. 0 is returned if the directory can not be 
 opened, 1 if it is opened.   
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkIdType = obj.GetNumberOfFiles ()</tt> -  Return the number of files in the current directory.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetFile (vtkIdType index)</tt> -  Return the file at the given index, the indexing is 0 based
