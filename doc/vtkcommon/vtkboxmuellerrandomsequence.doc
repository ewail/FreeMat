\section Usage
 vtkGaussianRandomSequence is a sequence of pseudo random numbers
 distributed according to the Gaussian/normal distribution (mean=0 and
 standard deviation=1).

 It based is calculation from a uniformly distributed pseudo random sequence.
 The initial sequence is a vtkMinimalStandardRandomSequence.

To create an instance of class vtkBoxMuellerRandomSequence, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkBoxMuellerRandomSequence
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkBoxMuellerRandomSequence has several methods that can be used.
