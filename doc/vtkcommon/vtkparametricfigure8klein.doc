\section Usage
 vtkParametricFigure8Klein generates a figure-8 Klein bottle.  A Klein bottle
 is a closed surface with no interior and only one surface.  It is
 unrealisable in 3 dimensions without intersecting surfaces.  It can be
 realised in 4 dimensions by considering the map \f$F:R^2 \rightarrow R^4\f$  given by:

 - \f$f(u,v) = ((r*cos(v)+a)*cos(u),(r*cos(v)+a)*sin(u),r*sin(v)*cos(u/2),r*sin(v)*sin(u/2))\f$

 This representation of the immersion in \f$R^3\f$ is formed by taking two Mobius
 strips and joining them along their boundaries, this is the so called
 "Figure-8 Klein Bottle"

 For further information about this surface, please consult the 
 technical description "Parametric surfaces" in http://www.vtk.org/documents.php 
 in the "VTK Technical Documents" section in the VTk.org web pages.

 .SECTION Thanks
 Andrew Maclean a.maclean@cas.edu.au for creating and contributing the
 class.


To create an instance of class vtkParametricFigure8Klein, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkParametricFigure8Klein
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkParametricFigure8Klein has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkParametricFigure8Klein class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParametricFigure8Klein = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParametricFigure8Klein = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRadius (double )</tt> -  Set/Get the radius of the bottle.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetRadius ()</tt> -  Set/Get the radius of the bottle.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDimension ()</tt> -  A Figure-8 Klein bottle.  

 This function performs the mapping \f$f(u,v) \rightarrow (x,y,x)\f$, returning it
 as Pt. It also returns the partial derivatives Du and Dv.
 \f$Pt = (x, y, z), Du = (dx/du, dy/du, dz/du), Dv = (dx/dv, dy/dv, dz/dv)\f$ .
 Then the normal is \f$N = Du X Dv\f$ .
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Evaluate (double uvw[3], double Pt[3], double Duvw[9])</tt> -  A Figure-8 Klein bottle.  

 This function performs the mapping \f$f(u,v) \rightarrow (x,y,x)\f$, returning it
 as Pt. It also returns the partial derivatives Du and Dv.
 \f$Pt = (x, y, z), Du = (dx/du, dy/du, dz/du), Dv = (dx/dv, dy/dv, dz/dv)\f$ .
 Then the normal is \f$N = Du X Dv\f$ .
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.EvaluateScalar (double uvw[3], double Pt[3], double Duvw[9])</tt> -  Calculate a user defined scalar using one or all of uvw, Pt, Duvw.

 uvw are the parameters with Pt being the the cartesian point, 
 Duvw are the derivatives of this point with respect to u, v and w.
 Pt, Duvw are obtained from Evaluate().

 This function is only called if the ScalarMode has the value
 vtkParametricFunctionSource::SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED

 If the user does not need to calculate a scalar, then the 
 instantiated function should return zero.
