\section Usage
 vtkParametricKlein generates a "classical" representation of a Klein
 bottle.  A Klein bottle is a closed surface with no interior and only one
 surface.  It is unrealisable in 3 dimensions without intersecting
 surfaces.  It can be
 realised in 4 dimensions by considering the map \f$F:R^2 \rightarrow R^4\f$  given by:

 - \f$f(u,v) = ((r*cos(v)+a)*cos(u),(r*cos(v)+a)*sin(u),r*sin(v)*cos(u/2),r*sin(v)*sin(u/2))\f$

 The classical representation of the immersion in \f$R^3\f$ is returned by this function.


 For further information about this surface, please consult the 
 technical description "Parametric surfaces" in http://www.vtk.org/documents.php 
 in the "VTK Technical Documents" section in the VTk.org web pages.

 .SECTION Thanks
 Andrew Maclean a.maclean@cas.edu.au for creating and contributing the
 class.


To create an instance of class vtkParametricKlein, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkParametricKlein
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkParametricKlein has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkParametricKlein class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParametricKlein = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParametricKlein = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDimension ()</tt> -  A Klein bottle.

 This function performs the mapping \f$f(u,v) \rightarrow (x,y,x)\f$, returning it
 as Pt. It also returns the partial derivatives Du and Dv.
 \f$Pt = (x, y, z), Du = (dx/du, dy/du, dz/du), Dv = (dx/dv, dy/dv, dz/dv)\f$ .
 Then the normal is \f$N = Du X Dv\f$ .
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Evaluate (double uvw[3], double Pt[3], double Duvw[9])</tt> -  A Klein bottle.

 This function performs the mapping \f$f(u,v) \rightarrow (x,y,x)\f$, returning it
 as Pt. It also returns the partial derivatives Du and Dv.
 \f$Pt = (x, y, z), Du = (dx/du, dy/du, dz/du), Dv = (dx/dv, dy/dv, dz/dv)\f$ .
 Then the normal is \f$N = Du X Dv\f$ .
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.EvaluateScalar (double uvw[3], double Pt[3], double Duvw[9])</tt> -  Calculate a user defined scalar using one or all of uvw, Pt, Duvw.

 uvw are the parameters with Pt being the the cartesian point, 
 Duvw are the derivatives of this point with respect to u, v and w.
 Pt, Duvw are obtained from Evaluate().

 This function is only called if the ScalarMode has the value
 vtkParametricFunctionSource::SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED

 If the user does not need to calculate a scalar, then the 
 instantiated function should return zero.
