Section: \ref sec_vtkcommon "Visualization Toolkit Common Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkCylindricalTransform will convert (r,theta,z) coordinates to 
 (x,y,z) coordinates and back again.  The angles are given in radians.
 By default, it converts cylindrical coordinates to rectangular, but
 GetInverse() returns a transform that will do the opposite.  The
 equation that is used is x = r*cos(theta), y = r*sin(theta), z = z.

To create an instance of class vtkCylindricalTransform, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCylindricalTransform
\endverbatim
