\section Usage
 This is a concrete sub-class of vtkInitialValueProblemSolver.
 It uses a 5th order Runge-Kutta method with stepsize control to obtain 
 the values of a set of functions at the next time step. The stepsize
 is adjusted by calculating an estimated error using an embedded 4th
 order Runge-Kutta formula:

To create an instance of class vtkRungeKutta45, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkRungeKutta45
\endverbatim
