\section Usage
 vtkProperty2D contains properties used to render two dimensional images
 and annotations.

To create an instance of class vtkProperty2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim

\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkProperty2D has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDisplayLocation (int )</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDisplayLocationMinValue ()</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDisplayLocationMaxValue ()</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDisplayLocation ()</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDisplayLocationToBackground ()</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDisplayLocationToForeground ()</tt> -  The DisplayLocation is either background or foreground.
 If it is background, then this 2D actor will be drawn
 behind all 3D props or foreground 2D actors. If it is
 background, then this 2D actor will be drawn in front of
 all 3D props and background 2D actors. Within 2D actors
 of the same DisplayLocation type, order is determined by
 the order in which the 2D actors were added to the viewport.
