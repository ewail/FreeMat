<p>
Section: \ref sec_variables "Variables and Arrays"
\section Usage
Persistent variables are variables whose value persists between
calls to a function or script.  The general syntax for its
use is
\verbatim
   persistent variable1 variable2 ... variableN
\endverbatim
The <tt>persistent</tt> statement must occur before the variable
is the tagged as persistent.  Per the MATLAB API documentation
an empty variable is created when the <tt>persistent</tt> statement
is called.
\section Example
Here is an example of a function that counts how many
times it has been called.

\if FILE
count_calls.m
function count_calls
  persistent ccount
  if isempty(ccount); ccount = 0; end;
  ccount = ccount + 1;
  printf('Function has been called %d times\n',ccount);
\endif
\verbatim
     count_calls.m
\endverbatim

\verbinclude count_calls.m

We now call the function several times:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_variables_persistent_000.m
0
for i=1:10; count_calls; end
\endif


\verbinclude frag_variables_persistent_000.m.out
