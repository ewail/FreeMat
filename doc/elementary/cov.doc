\page elementary_cov COV Covariance Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Computes the covariance of a matrix or a vector.  The general
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = cov(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is a matrix or a vector.  If <tt>x</tt> is a vector then
<tt>cov</tt> returns the variance of <tt>x</tt>.  If <tt>x</tt> is a matrix then
<tt>cov</tt> returns the covariance matrix of the columns of <tt>x</tt>.
You can also call <tt>cov</tt> with two arguments to compute the 
matrix of cross correlations.  The syntax for this mode is
\verbatim
  y = cov(x,z)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>z</tt> are matrices of the same size.  Finally,
you can provide a normalization flag <tt>d</tt> that is either <tt>0</tt>
or <tt>1</tt>, which changes the normalization factor from <tt>L-1</tt> (for <tt>d=0</tt>) to 
<tt>L</tt> (for <tt>d=1</tt>) where <tt>L</tt> is the number of rows in the matrix <tt>x</tt>.  In
this case, the syntaxes are
\verbatim
  y = cov(x,z,d)
\endverbatim
for the two-argument case, and
\verbatim
  y = cov(x,d)
\endverbatim
for the one-argument case.
\section Example
The following demonstrates some uses of the <tt>cov</tt> function

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cov_000.m
0
A = [5,1,3;3,2,1;0,3,1]
B = [4,-2,0;1,5,2;-2,0,1];
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cov_000.m.out 

We start with the covariance matrix for <tt>A</tt>

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cov_001.m
0
cov(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cov_001.m.out 

and again with the (biased) normalization

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cov_002.m
0
cov(A,1)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cov_002.m.out 

Here we compute the cross covariance between <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cov_003.m
0
cov(A,B)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cov_003.m.out 

and again with biased normalization

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cov_004.m
0
cov(A,B,1)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cov_004.m.out
