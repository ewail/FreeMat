\page elementary_imag IMAG Imaginary Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Returns the imaginary part of the input array for all elements.  The 
general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = imag(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensional array of numerical type.  The output 
is the same numerical type as the input, unless the input is <tt>complex</tt>
or <tt>dcomplex</tt>.  For <tt>complex</tt> inputs, the imaginary part is a floating
point array, so that the return type is <tt>float</tt>.  For <tt>dcomplex</tt>
inputs, the imaginary part is a double precision floating point array, so that
the return type is <tt>double</tt>.  The <tt>imag</tt> function returns zeros for 
real and integer types.
\section Example
The following demonstrates <tt>imag</tt> applied to a complex scalar.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_imag_000.m
0
imag(3+4*i)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_imag_000.m.out 

The imaginary part of real and integer arguments is a vector of zeros, the
same type and size of the argument.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_imag_001.m
0
imag([2,4,5,6])
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_imag_001.m.out 

For a double-precision complex array,

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_imag_002.m
0
imag([2.0+3.0*i,i])
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_imag_002.m.out
