\section Usage
\verbatim
	y=diff(x)
	y=diff(x,k)
	y=diff(x,k,dim)
\endverbatim
 Produce difference of successive vector elements.
 
 If <tt>x</tt> is a vector of length n, <tt>diff (x)</tt> is the
 vector of first differences
 \[
  [x_2 - x_1, ..., x_n - x_{n-1}].
 \]

 If <tt>x</tt> is a matrix, <tt>diff (x)</tt> is the matrix of column
 differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

 The second argument is optional.  If supplied, <tt>diff (x,k)</tt>,
 where <tt>k</tt> is a nonnegative integer, returns the
 <tt>k</tt>-th differences. It is possible that <tt>k</tt> is larger than
 then first non-singleton dimension of the matrix. In this case,
 <tt>diff</tt> continues to take the differences along the next
 non-singleton dimension.

 The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly
 stated with the optional variable <tt>dim</tt>. In this case the 
 <tt>k</tt>-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.
 In the case where <tt>k</tt> exceeds <tt>size (x, dim)</tt>
 then an empty matrix is returned.
