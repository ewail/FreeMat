\page elementary_dot DOT Dot Product Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Computes the scalar dot product of its two arguments.  The general
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = dot(x,z)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>z</tt> are numerical vectors of the same length.  If 
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>z</tt> are multi-dimensional arrays of the same size, then
the dot product is taken along the first non-singleton dimension.
You can also specify the dimension to take the dot product along using
the alternate form
\verbatim
  y = dot(x,z,dim)
\endverbatim
where <tt>dim</tt> specifies the dimension to take the dot product along.
