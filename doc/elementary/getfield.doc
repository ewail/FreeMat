\section Usage
Given a structure or structure array, returns the contents of the
specified field.  The first version is for scalar structures, and
has the following syntax
\verbatim
   y = getfield(x,'fieldname')
\endverbatim
and is equivalent to <tt>y = x.fieldname</tt> where <tt>x</tt> is a scalar (1 x 1)
structure.  If <tt>x</tt> is not a scalar structure, then <tt>y</tt> is the 
first value, i.e., it is equivalent to <tt>y = x(1).fieldname</tt>.  
The second form allows you to specify a subindex into a
structure array, and has the following syntax
\verbatim
    y = getfield(x, {m,n}, 'fieldname')
\endverbatim
and is equivalent to <tt>y = x(m,n).fieldname</tt>.  You can chain multiple
references together using this syntax.
