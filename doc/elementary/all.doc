\page elementary_all ALL All True Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Reduces a logical array along a given dimension by testing for all
logical 1s.  The general 
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = all(x,d)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensions array of <tt>logical</tt> type.
The output is of <tt>logical</tt> type.  The argument <tt>d</tt> is 
optional, and denotes the dimension along which to operate.
The output <tt>y</tt> is the same size as <tt>x</tt>, except that it is 
singular along the operated direction.  So, for example,
if <tt>x</tt> is a <tt>3 x 3 x 4</tt> array, and we <tt>all</tt> operation along
dimension <tt>d=2</tt>, then the output is of size <tt>3 x 1 x 4</tt>.
\section Function Internals
The output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},1,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) = 
\min_{k} x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p})
\f]
If <tt>d</tt> is omitted, then the minimum is taken over all elements of
<tt>x</tt>.
\section Example
The following piece of code demonstrates various uses of the <tt>all</tt>
function

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_all_000.m
0
A = [1,0,0;1,0,0;0,0,1]
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_all_000.m.out 

We start by calling <tt>all</tt> without a dimension argument, in which 
case it defaults to testing all values of <tt>A</tt>

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_all_001.m
0
all(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_all_001.m.out 

The <tt>all</tt> function is useful in expressions also.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_all_002.m
0
all(A>=0)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_all_002.m.out 

Next, we apply the <tt>all</tt> operation along the rows.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_all_003.m
0
all(A,2)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_all_003.m.out
