\page elementary_var VAR Variance Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Computes the variance of an array along a given dimension.  The general
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = var(x,d)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensions array of numerical type.
The output is of the same numerical type as the input.  The argument
<tt>d</tt> is optional, and denotes the dimension along which to take
the variance.  The output <tt>y</tt> is the same size as <tt>x</tt>, except
that it is singular along the mean direction.  So, for example,
if <tt>x</tt> is a <tt>3 x 3 x 4</tt> array, and we compute the mean along
dimension <tt>d=2</tt>, then the output is of size <tt>3 x 1 x 4</tt>.
\section Function Internals
The output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},1,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) = \frac{1}{N-1}
\sum_{k=1}^{N} \left(x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) 
 - \bar{x}\right)^2,
\f]
where 
\f[
\bar{x}  = \frac{1}{N}
\sum_{k=1}^{N} x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p})
\f]
If <tt>d</tt> is omitted, then the mean is taken along the 
first non-singleton dimension of <tt>x</tt>. 
\section Example
The following piece of code demonstrates various uses of the var
function

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_var_000.m
0
A = [5,1,3;3,2,1;0,3,1]
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_var_000.m.out 

We start by calling <tt>var</tt> without a dimension argument, in which 
case it defaults to the first nonsingular dimension (in this case, 
along the columns or <tt>d = 1</tt>).

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_var_001.m
0
var(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_var_001.m.out 

Next, we take the variance along the rows.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_var_002.m
0
var(A,2)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_var_002.m.out
