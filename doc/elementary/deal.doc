\section Usage
When making a function call, it is possible to assign
multiple outputs in a single call, (see, e.g., <tt>max</tt> for
an example).  The <tt>deal</tt> call allows you to do the 
same thing with a simple assignment.  The syntax for its
use is
\verbatim
   [a,b,c,...] = deal(expr)
\endverbatim
where <tt>expr</tt> is an expression with multiple values.  The simplest
example is where <tt>expr</tt> is the dereference of a cell array, e.g.
<tt>expr <-- A{:}</tt>.  In this case, the <tt>deal</tt> call is equivalent
to
\verbatim
   a = A{1}; b = A{2}; C = A{3}; 
\endverbatim
Other expressions which are multivalued are structure arrays with
multiple entries (non-scalar), where field dereferencing has been
applied.
