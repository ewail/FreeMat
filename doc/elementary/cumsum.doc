\page elementary_cumsum CUMSUM Cumulative Summation Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_elementary "Elementary Functions"
\section Usage
Computes the cumulative sum of an n-dimensional array along a given
dimension.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = cumsum(x,d)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is a multidimensional array of numerical type, and <tt>d</tt>
is the dimension along which to perform the cumulative sum.  The
output <tt>y</tt> is the same size of <tt>x</tt>.  Integer types are promoted
to <tt>int32</tt>. If the dimension <tt>d</tt> is not specified, then the
cumulative sum is applied along the first non-singular dimension.
\section Function Internals
The output is computed via
\f[
  y(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},j,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}) = 
  \sum_{k=1}^{j} x(m_1,\ldots,m_{d-1},k,m_{d+1},\ldots,m_{p}).
\f]
\section Example
The default action is to perform the cumulative sum along the
first non-singular dimension.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cumsum_000.m
0
A = [5,1,3;3,2,1;0,3,1]
cumsum(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cumsum_000.m.out 

To compute the cumulative sum along the columns:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cumsum_001.m
0
cumsum(A,2)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cumsum_001.m.out 

The cumulative sum also works along arbitrary dimensions

\if FRAGMENT
frag_elementary_cumsum_002.m
0
B(:,:,1) = [5,2;8,9];
B(:,:,2) = [1,0;3,0]
cumsum(B,3)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_elementary_cumsum_002.m.out
