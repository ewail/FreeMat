\page sparse_full FULL Convert Sparse Matrix to Full Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_sparse "Sparse Matrix Support"
\section Usage
Converts a sparse matrix to a full matrix.  The syntax for
its use is
\verbatim
   y = full(x)
\endverbatim
The type of <tt>x</tt> is preserved.  Be careful with the function.
As a general rule of thumb, if you can work with the <tt>full</tt>
representation of a function, you probably do not need the
sparse representation.
\section Example
Here we convert a full matrix to a sparse one, and back again.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_sparse_full_000.m
0
a = [1,0,4,2,0;0,0,0,0,0;0,1,0,0,2]
A = sparse(a)
full(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_sparse_full_000.m.out
