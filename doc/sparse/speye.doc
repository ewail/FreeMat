\page sparse_speye SPEYE Sparse Identity Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_sparse "Sparse Matrix Support"
\section Usage
Creates a sparse identity matrix of the given size.  The syntax for
its use is
\verbatim
  y = speye(m,n)
\endverbatim
which forms an <tt>m x n</tt> sparse matrix with ones on the main diagonal,
or
\verbatim
  y = speye(n)
\endverbatim
which forms an <tt>n x n</tt> sparse matrix with ones on the main diagonal.  The
matrix type is a <tt>float</tt> single precision matrix.
\section Example
The following creates a 5000 by 5000 identity matrix, which would be
difficult to do using <tt>sparse(eye(5000))</tt> because of the large amount
of intermediate storage required.
