Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkImageIslandRemoval2D computes the area of separate islands in 
 a mask image.  It removes any island that has less than AreaThreshold
 pixels.  Output has the same ScalarType as input.  It generates
 the whole 2D output image for any output request.

To create an instance of class vtkImageIslandRemoval2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageIslandRemoval2D
\endverbatim
\section Methods
