\section Usage
 vtkVoxelModeller is a filter that converts an arbitrary data set to a
 structured point (i.e., voxel) representation. It is very similar to 
 vtkImplicitModeller, except that it doesn't record distance; instead it
 records occupancy. By default it supports a compact output of 0/1
 VTK_BIT. Other vtk scalar types can be specified. The Foreground and
 Background values of the output can also be specified.
 NOTE: Not all vtk filters/readers/writers support the VTK_BIT
 scalar type. You may want to use VTK_CHAR as an alternative.

To create an instance of class vtkVoxelModeller, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkVoxelModeller
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkVoxelModeller has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
