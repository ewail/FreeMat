\section Usage
 vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm is a super class for filters that operate on an
 input neighborhood for each output pixel. It handles even sized
 neighborhoods, but their can be a half pixel shift associated with
 processing.  This superclass has some logic for handling boundaries.  It
 can split regions into boundary and non-boundary pieces and call different
 execute methods.

To create an instance of class vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkImageSpatialAlgorithm has several methods that can be used.
