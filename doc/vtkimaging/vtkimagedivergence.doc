\section Usage
 vtkImageDivergence takes a 3D vector field 
 and creates a scalar field which 
 which represents the rate of change of the vector field.
 The definition of Divergence:
 Given V = P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z),
 Divergence = dP/dx + dQ/dy + dR/dz.

To create an instance of class vtkImageDivergence, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageDivergence
\endverbatim
