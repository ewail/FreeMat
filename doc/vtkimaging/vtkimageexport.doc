\section Usage
 vtkImageExport provides a way of exporting image data at the end
 of a pipeline to a third-party system or to a simple C array.
 Applications can use this to get direct access to the image data
 in memory.  A callback interface is provided to allow connection
 of the VTK pipeline to a third-party pipeline.  This interface
 conforms to the interface of vtkImageImport.
 In Python it is possible to use this class to write the image data
 into a python string that has been pre-allocated to be the correct
 size.

To create an instance of class vtkImageExport, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageExport
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkImageExport has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkImageExport class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkImageExport = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkImageExport = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDataMemorySize ()</tt> -  Get the number of bytes required for the output C array.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetDataDimensions (int ptr)</tt> -  Get the (x,y,z) index dimensions of the data.  Please note
 that C arrays are indexed in decreasing order, i.e. array[z][y][x]. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDataDimensions ()</tt> -  Get the number of scalar components of the data.  Please note that
 when you index into a C array, the scalar component index comes
 last, i.e. array[z][y][x][c].
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDataNumberOfScalarComponents ()</tt> -  Get the number of scalar components of the data.  Please note that
 when you index into a C array, the scalar component index comes
 last, i.e. array[z][y][x][c].
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDataScalarType ()</tt> -  Get the scalar type of the data.  The scalar type of the C array
 must match the scalar type of the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetDataScalarTypeAsString ()</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDataExtent ()</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetDataExtent (int ptr)</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetDataSpacing ()</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetDataSpacing (double ptr)</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetDataOrigin ()</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetDataOrigin (double ptr)</tt> -  Get miscellaneous additional information about the data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ImageLowerLeftOn ()</tt> -  Set/Get whether the data goes to the exported memory starting 
 in the lower left corner or upper left corner.  Default: On.
 When this flag is Off, the image will be flipped vertically
 before it is exported.
 WARNING: this flag is used only with the Export() method,
 it is ignored by GetPointerToData().
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ImageLowerLeftOff ()</tt> -  Set/Get whether the data goes to the exported memory starting 
 in the lower left corner or upper left corner.  Default: On.
 When this flag is Off, the image will be flipped vertically
 before it is exported.
 WARNING: this flag is used only with the Export() method,
 it is ignored by GetPointerToData().
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetImageLowerLeft ()</tt> -  Set/Get whether the data goes to the exported memory starting 
 in the lower left corner or upper left corner.  Default: On.
 When this flag is Off, the image will be flipped vertically
 before it is exported.
 WARNING: this flag is used only with the Export() method,
 it is ignored by GetPointerToData().
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetImageLowerLeft (int )</tt> -  Set/Get whether the data goes to the exported memory starting 
 in the lower left corner or upper left corner.  Default: On.
 When this flag is Off, the image will be flipped vertically
 before it is exported.
 WARNING: this flag is used only with the Export() method,
 it is ignored by GetPointerToData().
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Export ()</tt> -  The main interface: update the pipeline and export the image
 to the memory pointed to by SetExportVoidPointer().  You can
 also specify a void pointer when you call Export().
 </LI>
