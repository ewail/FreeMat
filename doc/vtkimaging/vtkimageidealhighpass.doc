\section Usage
 This filter only works on an image after it has been converted to
 frequency domain by a vtkImageFFT filter.  A vtkImageRFFT filter
 can be used to convert the output back into the spatial domain.
 vtkImageIdealHighPass just sets a portion of the image to zero.  The sharp
 cutoff in the frequence domain produces ringing in the spatial domain.
 Input and Output must be doubles.  Dimensionality is set when the axes are
 set.  Defaults to 2D on X and Y axes.

To create an instance of class vtkImageIdealHighPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageIdealHighPass
\endverbatim
