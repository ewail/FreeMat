Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkImageSobel3D computes a vector field from a scalar field by using
 Sobel functions.  The number of vector components is 3 because
 the input is a volume.  Output is always doubles.  A little creative 
 liberty was used to extend the 2D sobel kernels into 3D.

To create an instance of class vtkImageSobel3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageSobel3D
\endverbatim
