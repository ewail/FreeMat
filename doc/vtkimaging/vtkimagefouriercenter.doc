<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 Is used for dispaying images in frequency space.  FFT converts spatial
 images into frequency space, but puts the zero frequency at the origin.
 This filter shifts the zero frequency to the center of the image.
 Input and output are assumed to be doubles.

To create an instance of class vtkImageFourierCenter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageFourierCenter
\endverbatim
