Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 This filter only works on an image after it has been converted to
 frequency domain by a vtkImageFFT filter.  A vtkImageRFFT filter
 can be used to convert the output back into the spatial domain.
 vtkImageButterworthHighPass  the frequency components around 0 are
 attenuated.  Input and output are in doubles, with two components
 (complex numbers).
 out(i, j) = 1 / (1 + pow(CutOff/Freq(i,j), 2*Order));

To create an instance of class vtkImageButterworthHighPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageButterworthHighPass
\endverbatim
