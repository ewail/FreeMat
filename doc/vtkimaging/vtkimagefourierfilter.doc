\section Usage
 vtkImageFourierFilter is a class of filters that use complex numbers
 this superclass is a container for methods that manipulate these structure
 including fast Fourier transforms.  Complex numbers may become a class.
 This should really be a helper class.

To create an instance of class vtkImageFourierFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageFourierFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkImageFourierFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
