Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkImageSeedConnectivity marks pixels connected to user supplied seeds.
 The input must be unsigned char, and the output is also unsigned char.  If
 a seed supplied by the user does not have pixel value "InputTrueValue",
 then the image is scanned +x, +y, +z until a pixel is encountered with
 value "InputTrueValue".  This new pixel is used as the seed .  Any pixel
 with out value "InputTrueValue" is consider off.  The output pixels values
 are 0 for any off pixel in input, "OutputTrueValue" for any pixels
 connected to seeds, and "OutputUnconnectedValue" for any on pixels not
 connected to seeds.  The same seeds are used for all images in the image
 set.

To create an instance of class vtkImageSeedConnectivity, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageSeedConnectivity
\endverbatim
