\section Usage
 vtkImageCanvasSource2D is a source that starts as a blank image.
 you may add to the image with two-dimensional drawing routines.
 It can paint multi-spectral images.

To create an instance of class vtkImageCanvasSource2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageCanvasSource2D
\endverbatim
