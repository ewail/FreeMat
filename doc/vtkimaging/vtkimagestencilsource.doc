\section Usage
 vtkImageStencilSource is a superclass for filters that generate image
 stencils.  Given a clipping object such as a vtkImplicitFunction, it
 will set up a list of clipping extents for each x-row through the
 image data.  The extents for each x-row can be retrieved via the 
 GetNextExtent() method after the extent lists have been built
 with the BuildExtents() method.  For large images, using clipping
 extents is much more memory efficient (and slightly more time-efficient)
 than building a mask.  This class can be subclassed to allow clipping
 with objects other than vtkImplicitFunction.

To create an instance of class vtkImageStencilSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageStencilSource
\endverbatim
