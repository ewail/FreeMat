\section Usage
 vtkImageCityBlockDistance creates a distance map using the city block
 (Manhatten) distance measure.  The input is a mask.  Zero values are
 considered boundaries.  The output pixel is the minimum of the input pixel
 and the distance to a boundary (or neighbor value + 1 unit).
 distance values are calculated in pixels.
 The filter works by taking 6 passes (for 3d distance map): 2 along each 
 axis (forward and backward). Each pass keeps a running minimum distance.
 For some reason, I preserve the sign if the distance.  If the input 
 mask is initially negative, the output distances will be negative.
 Distances maps can have inside (negative regions) 
 and outsides (positive regions).

To create an instance of class vtkImageCityBlockDistance, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageCityBlockDistance
\endverbatim
