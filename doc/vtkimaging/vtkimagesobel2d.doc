Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkImageSobel2D computes a vector field from a scalar field by using
 Sobel functions.  The number of vector components is 2 because
 the input is an image.  Output is always doubles.

To create an instance of class vtkImageSobel2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageSobel2D
\endverbatim
