Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 This filter only works on an image after it has been converted to
 frequency domain by a vtkImageFFT filter.  A vtkImageRFFT filter
 can be used to convert the output back into the spatial domain.
 vtkImageButterworthLowPass  the high frequency components are
 attenuated.  Input and output are in doubles, with two components
 (complex numbers).
 out(i, j) = (1 + pow(CutOff/Freq(i,j), 2*Order));

To create an instance of class vtkImageButterworthLowPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageButterworthLowPass
\endverbatim
\section Methods
