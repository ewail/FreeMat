Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkImageMagnify maps each pixel of the input onto a nxmx... region
 of the output.  Location (0,0,...) remains in the same place. The
 magnification occurs via pixel replication, or if Interpolate is on,
 by bilinear interpolation. Initially, interpolation is off and magnification
 factors are set to 1 in all directions.

To create an instance of class vtkImageMagnify, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageMagnify
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkImageMagnify has several methods that can be used.
