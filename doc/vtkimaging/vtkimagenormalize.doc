\section Usage
 For each point, vtkImageNormalize normalizes the vector defined by the 
 scalar components.  If the magnitude of this vector is zero, the output
 vector is zero also.

To create an instance of class vtkImageNormalize, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageNormalize
\endverbatim
