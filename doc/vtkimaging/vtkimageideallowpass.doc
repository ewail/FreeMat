Section: \ref sec_vtkimaging "Visualization Toolkit Imaging Classes"
\section Usage
 This filter only works on an image after it has been converted to
 frequency domain by a vtkImageFFT filter.  A vtkImageRFFT filter
 can be used to convert the output back into the spatial domain.
 vtkImageIdealLowPass just sets a portion of the image to zero.  The result
 is an image with a lot of ringing.  Input and Output must be doubles.
 Dimensionality is set when the axes are set.  Defaults to 2D on X and Y
 axes.

To create an instance of class vtkImageIdealLowPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageIdealLowPass
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkImageIdealLowPass has several methods that can be used.
