\page flow_for FOR For Loop

<p>
Section: \ref sec_flow "Flow Control"
\section Usage
The <tt>for</tt> loop executes a set of statements with an
index variable looping through each element in a vector.
The syntax of a <tt>for</tt> loop is one of the following:
\verbatim
  for (variable=expression)
     statements
  end
\endverbatim
Alternately, the parenthesis can be eliminated
\verbatim
  for variable=expression
     statements
  end
\endverbatim
or alternately, the index variable can be pre-initialized
with the vector of values it is going to take:
\verbatim
  for variable
     statements
  end
\endverbatim
The third form is essentially equivalent to <tt>for variable=variable</tt>,
where <tt>variable</tt> is both the index variable and the set of values
over which the for loop executes.  See the examples section for
an example of this form of the <tt>for</tt> loop.
\section Examples
Here we write <tt>for</tt> loops to add all the integers from
<tt>1</tt> to <tt>100</tt>.  We will use all three forms of the <tt>for</tt>
statement.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_flow_for_000.m
0
accum = 0;
for (i=1:100); accum = accum + i; end
accum
\endif


\verbinclude frag_flow_for_000.m.out 

The second form is functionally the same, without the
extra parenthesis

\if FRAGMENT
frag_flow_for_001.m
0
accum = 0;
for i=1:100; accum = accum + i; end
accum
\endif


\verbinclude frag_flow_for_001.m.out 

In the third example, we pre-initialize the loop variable
with the values it is to take

\if FRAGMENT
frag_flow_for_002.m
0
\endif


\verbinclude frag_flow_for_002.m.out
