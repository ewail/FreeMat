\page flow_while WHILE While Loop

<p>
Section: \ref sec_flow "Flow Control"
\section Usage
The <tt>while</tt> loop executes a set of statements as long as
a the test condition remains <tt>true</tt>.  The syntax of a
<tt>while</tt> loop is
\verbatim
  while test_expression
     statements
  end
\endverbatim
Note that a conditional expression is considered true if
the real part of the result of the expression contains
any non-zero elements (this strange convention is adopted
for compatibility with MATLAB).
\section Examples
Here is a <tt>while</tt> loop that adds the integers from <tt>1</tt>
to <tt>100</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_flow_while_000.m
0
accum = 0;
k=1;
while (k<=100), accum = accum + k; k = k + 1; end
accum
\endif


\verbinclude frag_flow_while_000.m.out
