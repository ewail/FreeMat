\page flow_break BREAK Exit Execution In Loop

<p>
Section: \ref sec_flow "Flow Control"
\section Usage
The <tt>break</tt> statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
It can be used inside a <tt>for</tt> loop or a <tt>while</tt> loop.  The
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   break
\endverbatim
inside the body of the loop.  The <tt>break</tt> statement forces
execution to exit the loop immediately.
\section Example
Here is a simple example of how <tt>break</tt> exits the loop.
We have a loop that sums integers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>10</tt>, but
that stops prematurely at <tt>5</tt> using a <tt>break</tt>.  We will
use a <tt>while</tt> loop.

\if FILE
break_ex.m
function accum = break_ex
  accum = 0;
  i = 1;
  while (i<=10)
    accum = accum + i;
    if (i == 5)
      break;
    end
    i = i + 1;
  end
\endif
\verbatim
     break_ex.m
\endverbatim

\verbinclude break_ex.m

The function is exercised here:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_flow_break_000.m
0
break_ex
sum(1:5)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_flow_break_000.m.out
