\page curvefit_polyval POLYVAL Evaluate Polynomial Fit at Selected Points

<p>
Section: \ref sec_curvefit "Optimization and Curve Fitting"
\section Usage
The <tt>polyval</tt> routine has the following syntax
\verbatim
  y = polyval(p,x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>p</tt> is a vector of polynomial coefficients,
in decreasing degree (as generated by <tt>polyfit</tt>, for example).
If <tt>x</tt> is a matrix, the polynomial is evaluated in the matrix
sense (in which case <tt>x</tt> must be square).
\section Function Internals
The polynomial is evaluated using a recursion method.  If the
polynomial is
\f[
   p(x) = p_1 x^n + p_2 x^{n-1} + \dots + p_n x + p_{n+1}
\f]
then the calculation is performed as
\f[
   p(x) = ((p_1) x + p_2) x + p_3
\f]
\section Example
Here is a plot of <tt>x^3</tt> generated using polyval

x = linspace(-1,1);
y = polyval(p,x);
plot(x,y,'r-')
