\page curvefit_polyder POLYDER Polynomial Coefficient Differentiation

<p>
Section: \ref sec_curvefit "Optimization and Curve Fitting"
\section Usage
The <tt>polyder</tt> function returns the polynomial coefficients resulting
from differentiation of polynomial <tt>p</tt>. The syntax for its use is either
\verbatim
 pder = polyder(p)
\endverbatim
 for the derivitave of polynomial p, or
\verbatim
 convp1p2der = polyder(p1,p2)
\endverbatim
 for the derivitave of polynomial conv(p1,p2), or still
\verbatim
 [nder,dder] = polyder(n,d)
\endverbatim
for the derivative of polynomial <tt>n/d</tt> (<tt>nder</tt> is the numerator
and <tt>dder</tt> is the denominator). In all cases the polynomial 
coefficients are assumed to be in decreasing degree.
