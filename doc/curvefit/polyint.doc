\page curvefit_polyint POLYINT Polynomial Coefficient Integration

<p>
Section: \ref sec_curvefit "Optimization and Curve Fitting"
\section Usage
 The polyint function returns the polynomial coefficients resulting
 from integration of polynomial p. The syntax for its use is either
\verbatim
 pint = polyint(p,k)
\endverbatim
 or, for a default <tt>k = 0</tt>,
\verbatim
 pint = polyint(p);
\endverbatim
 where <tt>p</tt> is a vector of polynomial coefficients assumed to be in
 decreasing degree and <tt>k</tt> is the integration constant.
