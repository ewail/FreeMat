\page curvefit_poly POLY Convert Roots To Polynomial Coefficients

<p>
Section: \ref sec_curvefit "Optimization and Curve Fitting"
\section Usage
This function calculates the polynomial coefficients for given roots
\verbatim
    p = poly(r)
\endverbatim
when <tt>r</tt> is a vector, is a vector whose elements are the coefficients 
of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of <tt>r</tt>.  Alternately,
you can provide a matrix
\verbatim
    p = poly(A)
\endverbatim
when <tt>A</tt> is an <tt>N x N</tt> square matrix, is a row vector with 
<tt>N+1</tt> elements which are the coefficients of the
characteristic polynomial, <tt>det(lambda*eye(size(A))-A)</tt>.
