<p>
Section: \ref sec_curvefit "Optimization and Curve Fitting"
\section Usage
The <tt>polyfit</tt> routine has the following syntax
\verbatim
  p = polyfit(x,y,n)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are vectors of the same size, and
<tt>n</tt> is the degree of the approximating polynomial.  
The resulting vector <tt>p</tt> forms the coefficients of
the optimal polynomial (in descending degree) that fit
<tt>y</tt> with <tt>x</tt>.  
\section Function Internals
The <tt>polyfit</tt> routine finds the approximating polynomial
\f[
   p(x) = p_1 x^n + p_2 x^{n-1} + \dots + p_n x + p_{n+1}
\f]
such that
\f[
   \sum_{i} (p(x_i) - y_i)^2
\f]
is minimized.  It does so by forming the Vandermonde matrix
and solving the resulting set of equations using the backslash
operator.  Note that the Vandermonde matrix can become poorly
conditioned with large <tt>n</tt> quite rapidly.
\section Example
A classic example from Edwards and Penny, consider the problem
of approximating a sinusoid with a polynomial.  We start with
a vector of points evenly spaced on the unit interval, along with
a vector of the sine of these points.

x = linspace(0,1,20);
y = sin(2*pi*x);
plot(x,y,'r-')
mprint polyfit1

\verbinclude frag_curvefit_polyfit_000.m.out 

The resulting plot is shown here

Next, we fit a third degree polynomial to the sine, and use
<tt>polyval</tt> to plot it

\if FRAGMENT
frag_curvefit_polyfit_001.m

p = polyfit(x,y,3)
f = polyval(p,x);
plot(x,y,'r-',x,f,'ko');
mprint polyfit2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_curvefit_polyfit_001.m.out 

The resulting plot is shown here

Increasing the order improves the fit, as

p = polyfit(x,y,11)
f = polyval(p,x);
plot(x,y,'r-',x,f,'ko');
mprint polyfit3
\endif


\verbinclude frag_curvefit_polyfit_002.m.out 

The resulting plot is shown here
