\section Usage
Given a set of monotonically increasing <tt>x</tt> coordinates and a 
corresponding set of <tt>y</tt> values, performs simple linear 
interpolation to a new set of <tt>x</tt> coordinates. The general syntax
for its usage is
\verbatim
   zi = interp2(z,xi,yi)
\endverbatim
where <tt>xi</tt> and <tt>yi</tt> are vectors of the same length. The output
vector <tt>zi</tt> is the same size as the input vector <tt>xi</tt>.
For each element of <tt>xi</tt>, the values in <tt>zi</tt> are linearly interpolated
by default. Interpolation method can be selected as:
\verbatim
   zi = interp2(z,xi,yi,method)
\endverbatim
Default interpolation method is <tt>'linear'</tt>. Other methods are
 <tt>'nearest'</tt>, and <tt>'cubic'</tt>.
For values in <tt>xi, yi</tt> that are outside the size of <tt>z</tt>,
the default value returned is NaN.  To change this behavior,
you can specify the extrapolation value:
\verbatim
   zi = interp2(z,xi,yi,method,extrapval)
\endverbatim
The <tt>z</tt> and <tt>xi,yi</tt> vectors must be real, although complex types
are allowed for <tt>z</tt>.
