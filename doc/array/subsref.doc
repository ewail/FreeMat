\section Usage
This function can be used to index into basic array
types (or structures).  It provides a functional interface
to execute complex indexing expressions such as 
<tt>a.b(3){5}</tt> at run time (i.e. while executing a script or
a function) without resorting to using <tt>eval</tt>.  Note that
this function should be overloaded for use with user defined
classes, and that it cannot be overloaeded for base types.
The basic syntax of the function is:
\verbatim
   b = subsref(a,s)
\endverbatim
where <tt>s</tt> is a structure array with two fields. The
first field is
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>type</tt>  is a string containing either <tt>'()'</tt> or
 <tt>'{}'</tt> or <tt>'.'</tt> depending on the form of the call.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>subs</tt> is a cell array or string containing the
 the subscript information.
 </LI>
</UL>
When multiple indexing experssions are combined together
such as <tt>b = a(5).foo{:}</tt>, the <tt>s</tt> array should contain
the following entries
\verbatim
  s(1).type = '()'  s(1).subs = {5}
  s(2).type = '.'   s(2).subs = 'foo'
  s(3).type = '{}'  s(3).subs = ':'
\endverbatim
