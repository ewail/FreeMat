\page array_squeeze SQUEEZE Remove Singleton Dimensions of an Array

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
This function removes the singleton dimensions of an array.  The
syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = squeeze(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is a multidimensional array.  Generally speaking, if
<tt>x</tt> is of size <tt>d1 x 1 x d2 x ...</tt>, then <tt>squeeze(x)</tt> is of
size <tt>d1 x d2 x ...</tt>, i.e., each dimension of <tt>x</tt> that was
singular (size 1) is squeezed out.
\section Example
Here is a many dimensioned, ungainly array, both before and 
after squeezing;

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_squeeze_000.m
0
x = zeros(1,4,3,1,1,2);
size(x)
y = squeeze(x);
size(y)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_squeeze_000.m.out
