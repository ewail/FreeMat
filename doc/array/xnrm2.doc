<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
Calculates the 2-norm of a vector.  The syntax for its use
is
\verbatim
   y = xnrm2(A)
\endverbatim
where <tt>A</tt> is the n-dimensional array to analyze.  This form
uses the underlying BLAS implementation to compute the 2-norm.
