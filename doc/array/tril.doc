\page array_tril TRIL Lower Triangular Matrix Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
 
 Returns the lower triangular matrix of a square matrix. The general
 syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = tril(x)
\endverbatim
 where |x| is a square matrix. This returns the lower triangular matrix
 (i.e.: all cells on or above the diagonal are set to 0). You can also
 specify a different diagonal using the alternate form
\verbatim
   y = tril(x,n)
\endverbatim
 where n is the diagonal offset. In this mode, the diagonal specified 
 is not set to zero in the returned matrix (e.g.: tril(x) and tril(x,-1))
 will return the same value.
