\page array_rcond RCOND Reciprocal Condition Number Estimate

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
The <tt>rcond</tt> function is a FreeMat wrapper around LAPACKs
function <tt>XGECON</tt>, which estimates the 1-norm condition
number (reciprocal).  For the details of the algorithm see
the LAPACK documentation.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   x = rcond(A)
\endverbatim
where <tt>A</tt> is a matrix.
\section Example
Here is the reciprocal condition number for a random square
matrix

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_rcond_000.m
0
A = rand(30);
rcond(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_rcond_000.m.out 

And here we calculate the same value using the definition of
(reciprocal) condition number

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_rcond_001.m
0
1/(norm(A,1)*norm(inv(A),1))
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_rcond_001.m.out 

Note that the values are very similar.  LAPACKs <tt>rcond</tt>
function is far more efficient than the explicit calculation
(which is also used by the <tt>cond</tt> function.
