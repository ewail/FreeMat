\page array_det DET Determinant of a Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
Calculates the determinant of a matrix.  Note that for all but
very small problems, the determinant is not particularly useful.
The condition number <tt>cond</tt> gives a more reasonable estimate as
to the suitability of a matrix for inversion than comparing <tt>det(A)</tt>
to zero.  In any case, the syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = det(A)
\endverbatim
where A is a square matrix.
\section Function Internals
The determinant is calculated via the <tt>LU</tt> decomposition.  Note that
the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the 
determinants.  Then, we have that 
\f[
  L U = P A
\f]
where <tt>L</tt> is lower triangular with 1s on the main diagonal, <tt>U</tt> is
upper triangular, and <tt>P</tt> is a row-permutation matrix.  Taking the
determinant of both sides yields
\f[
 |L U| = |L| |U| = |U| = |P A| = |P| |A|
\f]
where we have used the fact that the determinant of <tt>L</tt> is 1.  The
determinant of <tt>P</tt> (which is a row exchange matrix) is either 1 or 
-1.
\section Example
Here we assemble a random matrix and compute its determinant

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_det_000.m
0
A = rand(5);
det(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_det_000.m.out 

Then, we exchange two rows of <tt>A</tt> to demonstrate how the determinant
changes sign (but the magnitude is the same)

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_det_001.m
0
B = A([2,1,3,4,5],:);
det(B)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_det_001.m.out
