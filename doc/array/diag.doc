\page array_diag DIAG Diagonal Matrix Construction/Extraction

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
The <tt>diag</tt> function is used to either construct a 
diagonal matrix from a vector, or return the diagonal
elements of a matrix as a vector.  The general syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
  y = diag(x,n)
\endverbatim
If <tt>x</tt> is a matrix, then <tt>y</tt> returns the <tt>n</tt>-th 
diagonal.  If <tt>n</tt> is omitted, it is assumed to be
zero.  Conversely, if <tt>x</tt> is a vector, then <tt>y</tt>
is a matrix with <tt>x</tt> set to the <tt>n</tt>-th diagonal.
\section Examples
Here is an example of <tt>diag</tt> being used to extract
a diagonal from a matrix.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_diag_000.m
0
A = int32(10*rand(4,5))
diag(A)
diag(A,1)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_diag_000.m.out 

Here is an example of the second form of <tt>diag</tt>, being
used to construct a diagonal matrix.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_diag_001.m
0
x = int32(10*rand(1,3))
diag(x)
diag(x,-1)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_diag_001.m.out
