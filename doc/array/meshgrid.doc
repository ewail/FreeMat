\page array_meshgrid MESHGRID Generate Grid Mesh For Plots

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
The <tt>meshgrid</tt> function generates arrays that can be used for the
generation of surface plots.  The syntax is one of 
\verbatim
  [X,Y] = meshgrid(x)
  [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y)
  [X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x,y,z</tt> are vectors, and <tt>X,Y,Z</tt> are matrices.  In the first
case <tt>[X,Y] = meshgrid(x)</tt>, the rows of <tt>X</tt> and the columns of <tt>Y</tt>
contain copies of the vector <tt>x</tt>.  In the second case 
<tt>[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y)</tt>, the rows of <tt>X</tt> contain copies of <tt>x</tt>, and
the columns of <tt>Y</tt> contain copies of <tt>y</tt>.  In the third case, each
input is copied along the row, column or slice direction of the
corresponding output variable.
\section Example
In the first example:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_meshgrid_000.m
0
[X,Y] = meshgrid(-2:.4:2)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_meshgrid_000.m.out 

Next, we use different vectors for <tt>X</tt> and for <tt>Y</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_meshgrid_001.m
0
[X,Y] = meshgrid([1,2,3,4],[6,7,8])
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_meshgrid_001.m.out
