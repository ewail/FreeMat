\page array_cond COND Condition Number of a Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
Calculates the condition number of a matrix.  To compute the
2-norm condition number of a matrix (ratio of largest to smallest
singular values), use the syntax
\verbatim
   y = cond(A)
\endverbatim
where A is a matrix.  If you want to compute the condition number
in a different norm (e.g., the 1-norm), use the second syntax
\verbatim
   y = cond(A,p)
\endverbatim
where <tt>p</tt> is the norm to use when computing the condition number.
The following choices of <tt>p</tt> are supported
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>p = 1</tt> returns the 1-norm, or the max column sum of A
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>p = 2</tt> returns the 2-norm (largest singular value of A)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>p = inf</tt> returns the infinity norm, or the max row sum of A
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>p = 'fro'</tt> returns the Frobenius-norm (vector Euclidean norm, or RMS value)
 </LI>
</UL>
\section Function Internals
The condition number is defined as
\f[
  \frac{\|A\|_p}{\|A^{-1}\|_p}
\f]
This equation is precisely how the condition number is computed for
the case <tt>p ~= 2</tt>.  For the <tt>p=2</tt> case, the condition number can 
be computed much more efficiently using the ratio of the largest and
smallest singular values.
\section Example
The condition number of this matrix is large

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_cond_000.m
0
A = [1,1;0,1e-15]
cond(A)
cond(A,1)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_cond_000.m.out 

You can also (for the case <tt>p=1</tt> use <tt>rcond</tt> to calculate an estimate
of the condition number

\if FRAGMENT
frag_array_cond_001.m
0
1/rcond(A)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_array_cond_001.m.out
