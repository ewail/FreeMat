\page array_rref RREF Reduced Row Echelon Form of a Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_array "Array Generation and Manipulations"
\section Usage
Calculates the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using Gauss
Jordan elimination with partial pivoting.  The generic syntax
for <tt>rref</tt> is 
\verbatim
   R = rref(A)
\endverbatim
A default tolerance of <tt>max(size(A))*eps*norm(A,inf)</tt> is used to
detect negligible column elements.  The second form of <tt>rref</tt> 
returns a vector <tt>k</tt> as well as <tt>R</tt>
\verbatim
  [R,k] = rref(A)
\endverbatim
where <tt>k</tt> is a vector that correponds to the columns of <tt>A</tt> 
used as pivot columns.  If you want to control the tolerance
used to identify negligible elements, you can use the form
\verbatim
  [R,k] = rref(A, tolerance)
\endverbatim
This implementation of <tt>rref</tt> is based on the one from 
the matcompat lib for octave.  It is copyright Paul Kienzle,
