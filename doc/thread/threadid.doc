/*!
\page thread_threadid THREADID Get Current Thread Handle

<p>
Section: \ref sec_thread "FreeMat Threads"
\section Usage
The <tt>threadid</tt> function in FreeMat tells you which thread
is executing the context you are in.  Normally, this is thread
1, the main thread.  However, if you start a new thread using
<tt>threadnew</tt>, you will be operating in a new thread, and functions
that call <tt>threadid</tt> from the new thread will return their 
handles.
\section Example
From the main thread, we have

\if FRAGMENT
frag_thread_threadid_000.m
0
threadid
\endif


\verbinclude frag_thread_threadid_000.m.out 

But from a launched auxilliary thread, we have

\if FRAGMENT
frag_thread_threadid_001.m
0
t_id = threadnew
id = threadcall(t_id,1000,'threadid')
threadfree(t_id);
\endif


\verbinclude frag_thread_threadid_001.m.out
