\section Usage
The <tt>threadcall</tt> function is a convenience function for executing
a function call in a thread.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   [val1,...,valn] = threadcall(threadid,timeout,funcname,arg1,arg2,...)
\endverbatim
where <tt>threadid</tt> is the ID of the thread (as returned by the
<tt>threadnew</tt> function), <tt>funcname</tt> is the name of the function to call,
and <tt>argi</tt> are the arguments to the function, and <tt>timeout</tt> is the
amount of time (in milliseconds) that the function is allowed to take.
\section Example
Here is an example of executing a simple function in a different thread.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_thread_threadcall_000.m
0
id = threadnew
d = threadcall(id,1000,'cos',1.02343)
threadfree(id)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_thread_threadcall_000.m.out
