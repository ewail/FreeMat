Section: \ref sec_signal "Signal Processing Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>conv</tt> function performs a one-dimensional convolution of two
vector arguments.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
     z = conv(x,y)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are vectors.  The output is of length <tt>nx + ny -1</tt>.
The <tt>conv</tt> function calls <tt>conv2</tt> to do the calculation.  See its
help for more details.
