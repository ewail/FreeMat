\section Usage
 vtkGeoView is a 3D globe view. The globe may contain a multi-resolution
 geometry source (vtkGeoTerrain), multiple multi-resolution image sources
 (vtkGeoAlignedImageRepresentation), as well as other representations such
 as vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation. At a minimum, the view must have a terrain
 and one image representation. The view uses vtkGeoInteractorStyle to orbit,
 zoom, and tilt the view, and contains a vtkCompassWidget for manipulating
 the camera.

 Each terrain or image representation contains a vtkGeoSource subclass which
 generates geometry or imagery at multiple resolutions. As the camera
 position changes, the terrain and/or image representations may ask its
 vtkGeoSource to refine the geometry. This refinement is performed on a
 separate thread, and the data is added to the view when it becomes available.


To create an instance of class vtkGeoView, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGeoView
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkGeoView has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkGeoView class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGeoView = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGeoView = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGeoAlignedImageRepresentation = obj.AddDefaultImageRepresentation (vtkImageData image)</tt> -  Adds an image representation with a simple terrain model using
 the image in the specified file as the globe terrain.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.PrepareForRendering ()</tt>
