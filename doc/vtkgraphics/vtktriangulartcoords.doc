\section Usage
 vtkTriangularTCoords is a filter that generates texture coordinates
 for triangles. Texture coordinates for each triangle are:
 (0,0), (1,0) and (.5,sqrt(3)/2). This filter assumes that the triangle
 texture map is symmetric about the center of the triangle. Thus the order
 Of the texture coordinates is not important. The procedural texture
 in vtkTriangularTexture is designed with this symmetry. For more information
 see the paper "Opacity-modulating Triangular Textures for Irregular 
 Surfaces,"  by Penny Rheingans, IEEE Visualization '96, pp. 219-225.

To create an instance of class vtkTriangularTCoords, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTriangularTCoords
\endverbatim
