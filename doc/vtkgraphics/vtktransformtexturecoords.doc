\section Usage
 vtkTransformTextureCoords is a filter that operates on texture
 coordinates. It ingests any type of dataset, and outputs a dataset of the
 same type. The filter lets you scale, translate, and rotate texture
 coordinates. For example, by using the the Scale ivar, you can shift
 texture coordinates that range from (0->1) to range from (0->10) (useful
 for repeated patterns).
 
 The filter operates on texture coordinates of dimension 1->3. The texture 
 coordinates are referred to as r-s-t. If the texture map is two dimensional,
 the t-coordinate (and operations on the t-coordinate) are ignored.

To create an instance of class vtkTransformTextureCoords, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTransformTextureCoords
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTransformTextureCoords has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTransformTextureCoords class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTransformTextureCoords = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTransformTextureCoords = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition (double , double , double )</tt> -  Set/Get the position of the texture map. Setting the position translates
 the texture map by the amount specified. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition (double  a[3])</tt> -  Set/Get the position of the texture map. Setting the position translates
 the texture map by the amount specified. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetPosition ()</tt> -  Set/Get the position of the texture map. Setting the position translates
 the texture map by the amount specified. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.AddPosition (double deltaR, double deltaS, double deltaT)</tt> -  Incrementally change the position of the texture map (i.e., does a
 translate or shift of the texture coordinates).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.AddPosition (double deltaPosition[3])</tt> -  Incrementally change the position of the texture map (i.e., does a
 translate or shift of the texture coordinates).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetScale (double , double , double )</tt> -  Set/Get the scale of the texture map. Scaling in performed independently 
 on the r, s and t axes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetScale (double  a[3])</tt> -  Set/Get the scale of the texture map. Scaling in performed independently 
 on the r, s and t axes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetScale ()</tt> -  Set/Get the scale of the texture map. Scaling in performed independently 
 on the r, s and t axes.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOrigin (double , double , double )</tt> -  Set/Get the origin of the texture map. This is the point about which the
 texture map is flipped (e.g., rotated). Since a typical texture map ranges
 from (0,1) in the r-s-t coordinates, the default origin is set at 
 (0.5,0.5,0.5).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOrigin (double  a[3])</tt> -  Set/Get the origin of the texture map. This is the point about which the
 texture map is flipped (e.g., rotated). Since a typical texture map ranges
 from (0,1) in the r-s-t coordinates, the default origin is set at 
 (0.5,0.5,0.5).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetOrigin ()</tt> -  Set/Get the origin of the texture map. This is the point about which the
 texture map is flipped (e.g., rotated). Since a typical texture map ranges
 from (0,1) in the r-s-t coordinates, the default origin is set at 
 (0.5,0.5,0.5).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFlipR (int )</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetFlipR ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipROn ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipROff ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFlipS (int )</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetFlipS ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipSOn ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipSOff ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 s-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFlipT (int )</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 t-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetFlipT ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 t-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipTOn ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 t-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FlipTOff ()</tt> -  Boolean indicates whether the texture map should be flipped around the 
 t-axis. Note that the flips occur around the texture origin.
