\section Usage
 Reconstructs material interfaces from a mesh containing mixed cells (where several materials are mixed)
 this implementation is based on the youngs algorithm, generalized to arbitrary cell types and works
 on both 2D and 3D meshes. the main advantage of the youngs algorithm is it guarantees the material volume correctness.
 for 2D meshes, the AxisSymetric flag allows to switch between a pure 2D (plannar) algorithm and an axis symetric 2D algorithm
 handling volumes of revolution.
