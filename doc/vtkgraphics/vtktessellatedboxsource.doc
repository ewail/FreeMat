\section Usage
 vtkTessellatedBoxSource creates a axis-aligned box defined by its bounds
 and a level of subdivision. Connectivity is strong: points of the vertices
 and inside the edges are shared between faces. In other words, faces are
 connected. Each face looks like a grid of quads, each quad is composed of
 2 triangles.
 Given a level of subdivision `l', each edge has `l'+2 points, `l' of them
 are internal edge points, the 2 other ones are the vertices.
 Each face has a total of (`l'+2)*(`l'+2) points, 4 of them are vertices,
 4*`l' are internal edge points, it remains `l'^2 internal face points.

 This source only generate geometry, no DataArrays like normals or texture
 coordinates.

To create an instance of class vtkTessellatedBoxSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTessellatedBoxSource
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTessellatedBoxSource has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTessellatedBoxSource class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTessellatedBoxSource = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTessellatedBoxSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetBounds (double , double , double , double , double , double )</tt> -  Set the bounds of the box. See GetBounds() for a detail description.
 \pre xmin<=xmax && ymin<=ymax && zmin<zmax
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetBounds (double  a[6])</tt> -  Set the bounds of the box. See GetBounds() for a detail description.
 \pre xmin<=xmax && ymin<=ymax && zmin<zmax
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetBounds ()</tt> -  Bounds of the box in world coordinates. This a 6-uple of xmin,xmax,ymin,
 ymax,zmin and zmax. Initial value is (-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5), bounds
 of a cube of length 1 centered at (0,0,0). Bounds are defined such that
 xmin<=xmax, ymin<=ymax and zmin<zmax.
 \post xmin<=xmax && ymin<=ymax && zmin<zmax
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLevel (int )</tt> -  Set the level of subdivision of the faces.
 \pre positive_level: level>=0
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetLevel ()</tt> -  Level of subdivision of the faces. Initial value is 0.
 \post positive_level: level>=0
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDuplicateSharedPoints (int )</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to duplicate points shared between faces
 (vertices of the box and internal edge points). Initial value is false.
 Implementation note: duplicating points is an easier method to implement
 than a minimal number of points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDuplicateSharedPoints ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to duplicate points shared between faces
 (vertices of the box and internal edge points). Initial value is false.
 Implementation note: duplicating points is an easier method to implement
 than a minimal number of points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.DuplicateSharedPointsOn ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to duplicate points shared between faces
 (vertices of the box and internal edge points). Initial value is false.
 Implementation note: duplicating points is an easier method to implement
 than a minimal number of points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.DuplicateSharedPointsOff ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to duplicate points shared between faces
 (vertices of the box and internal edge points). Initial value is false.
 Implementation note: duplicating points is an easier method to implement
 than a minimal number of points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetQuads (int )</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to generate either a quad or two triangle for a
 set of four points. Initial value is false (generate triangles).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetQuads ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to generate either a quad or two triangle for a
 set of four points. Initial value is false (generate triangles).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.QuadsOn ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to generate either a quad or two triangle for a
 set of four points. Initial value is false (generate triangles).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.QuadsOff ()</tt> -  Flag to tell the source to generate either a quad or two triangle for a
 set of four points. Initial value is false (generate triangles).
