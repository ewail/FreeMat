\section Usage
 vtkWarpScalar is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving
 points along point normals by the scalar amount times the scale factor.
 Useful for creating carpet or x-y-z plots.

 If normals are not present in data, the Normal instance variable will
 be used as the direction along which to warp the geometry. If normals are
 present but you would like to use the Normal instance variable, set the 
 UseNormal boolean to true.

 If XYPlane boolean is set true, then the z-value is considered to be 
 a scalar value (still scaled by scale factor), and the displacement is
 along the z-axis. If scalars are also present, these are copied through
 and can be used to color the surface.

 Note that the filter passes both its point data and cell data to
 its output, except for normals, since these are distorted by the
 warping.

To create an instance of class vtkWarpScalar, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkWarpScalar
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkWarpScalar has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkWarpScalar class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkWarpScalar = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkWarpScalar = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetScaleFactor (double )</tt> -  Specify value to scale displacement.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetScaleFactor ()</tt> -  Specify value to scale displacement.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetUseNormal (int )</tt> -  Turn on/off use of user specified normal. If on, data normals
 will be ignored and instance variable Normal will be used instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetUseNormal ()</tt> -  Turn on/off use of user specified normal. If on, data normals
 will be ignored and instance variable Normal will be used instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UseNormalOn ()</tt> -  Turn on/off use of user specified normal. If on, data normals
 will be ignored and instance variable Normal will be used instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UseNormalOff ()</tt> -  Turn on/off use of user specified normal. If on, data normals
 will be ignored and instance variable Normal will be used instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNormal (double , double , double )</tt> -  Normal (i.e., direction) along which to warp geometry. Only used
 if UseNormal boolean set to true or no normals available in data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNormal (double  a[3])</tt> -  Normal (i.e., direction) along which to warp geometry. Only used
 if UseNormal boolean set to true or no normals available in data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetNormal ()</tt> -  Normal (i.e., direction) along which to warp geometry. Only used
 if UseNormal boolean set to true or no normals available in data.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetXYPlane (int )</tt> -  Turn on/off flag specifying that input data is x-y plane. If x-y plane,
 then the z value is used to warp the surface in the z-axis direction 
 (times the scale factor) and scalars are used to color the surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetXYPlane ()</tt> -  Turn on/off flag specifying that input data is x-y plane. If x-y plane,
 then the z value is used to warp the surface in the z-axis direction 
 (times the scale factor) and scalars are used to color the surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.XYPlaneOn ()</tt> -  Turn on/off flag specifying that input data is x-y plane. If x-y plane,
 then the z value is used to warp the surface in the z-axis direction 
 (times the scale factor) and scalars are used to color the surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.XYPlaneOff ()</tt> -  Turn on/off flag specifying that input data is x-y plane. If x-y plane,
 then the z value is used to warp the surface in the z-axis direction 
 (times the scale factor) and scalars are used to color the surface.
