\section Usage
 vtkTransformFilter is a filter to transform point coordinates, and 
 associated point normals and vectors. Other point data is passed
 through the filter.

 An alternative method of transformation is to use vtkActor's methods
 to scale, rotate, and translate objects. The difference between the
 two methods is that vtkActor's transformation simply effects where
 objects are rendered (via the graphics pipeline), whereas
 vtkTransformFilter actually modifies point coordinates in the 
 visualization pipeline. This is necessary for some objects 
 (e.g., vtkProbeFilter) that require point coordinates as input.

To create an instance of class vtkTransformFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTransformFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTransformFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTransformFilter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTransformFilter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTransformFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>long = obj.GetMTime ()</tt> -  Return the MTime also considering the transform.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetTransform (vtkAbstractTransform )</tt> -  Specify the transform object used to transform points.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAbstractTransform = obj.GetTransform ()</tt> -  Specify the transform object used to transform points.
