\section Usage
 vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter is a filter that extracts cells that
 share common points and/or satisfy a scalar threshold
 criterion. (Such a group of cells is called a region.) The filter
 works in one of six ways: 1) extract the largest connected region
 in the dataset; 2) extract specified region numbers; 3) extract all
 regions sharing specified point ids; 4) extract all regions sharing
 specified cell ids; 5) extract the region closest to the specified
 point; or 6) extract all regions (used to color regions).

 This filter is specialized for polygonal data. This means it runs a bit 
 faster and is easier to construct visualization networks that process
 polygonal data.

 The behavior of vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter can be modified by turning
 on the boolean ivar ScalarConnectivity. If this flag is on, the
 connectivity algorithm is modified so that cells are considered connected
 only if 1) they are geometrically connected (share a point) and 2) the
 scalar values of one of the cell's points falls in the scalar range
 specified. This use of ScalarConnectivity is particularly useful for
 selecting cells for later processing.

To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter
\endverbatim
