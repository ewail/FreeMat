\section Usage
 vtkExtractArraysOverTime extracts a selection over time.
 The output is a multiblock dataset. If selection content type is  
 vtkSelection::Locations, then each output block corresponds to each probed
 location. Otherwise, each output block corresponds to an extracted cell/point
 depending on whether the selection field type is CELL or POINT.
 Each block is a vtkTable with a column named Time (or TimeData if Time exists
 in the input).
 When extracting point data, the input point coordinates are copied
 to a column named Point Coordinates or Points (if Point Coordinates
 exists in the input).
 This algorithm does not produce a TIME_STEPS or TIME_RANGE information
 because it works across time. 
 .Section Caveat
 This algorithm works only with source that produce TIME_STEPS().
 Continuous time range is not yet supported.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractArraysOverTime, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkExtractArraysOverTime
\endverbatim
