Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 Computes a geometry based vector field that the DataSetGradient filter uses to accelerate
 gradient computation. This vector field is added to FieldData since it has a different
 value for each vertex of each cell (a vertex shared by two cell has two differents values).
