\section Usage
 vtkLinkEdgels links edgels into digital curves which are then stored 
 as polylines. The algorithm works one pixel at a time only looking at
 its immediate neighbors. There is a GradientThreshold that can be set 
 that eliminates any pixels with a smaller gradient value. This can
 be used as the lower threshold of a two value edgel thresholding. 

 For the remaining edgels, links are first tried for the four
 connected neighbors.  A successful neighbor will satisfy three
 tests. First both edgels must be above the gradient
 threshold. Second, the difference between the orientation between
 the two edgels (Alpha) and each edgels orientation (Phi) must be
 less than LinkThreshold. Third, the difference between the two
 edgels Phi values must be less than PhiThreshold.
 The most successful link is selected. The measure is simply the 
 sum of the three angle differences (actually stored as the sum of
 the cosines). If none of the four connect neighbors succeeds, then
 the eight connect neighbors are examined using the same method.
  
 This filter requires gradient information so you will need to use
 a vtkImageGradient at some point prior to this filter.  Typically
 a vtkNonMaximumSuppression filter is also used. vtkThresholdEdgels
 can be used to complete the two value edgel thresholding as used
 in a Canny edge detector. The vtkSubpixelPositionEdgels filter 
 can also be used after this filter to adjust the edgel locations.

To create an instance of class vtkLinkEdgels, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
