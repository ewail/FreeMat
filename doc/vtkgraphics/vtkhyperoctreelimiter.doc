\section Usage
 This filter returns a lower resolution copy of its input vtkHyperOctree.
 It does a length/area/volume weighted averaging to obtain data at each
 cut point. Above the cut level, leaf attribute data is simply copied.

To create an instance of class vtkHyperOctreeLimiter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkHyperOctreeLimiter
\endverbatim
