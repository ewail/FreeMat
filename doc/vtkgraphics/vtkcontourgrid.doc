\section Usage
 vtkContourGrid is a filter that takes as input datasets of type
 vtkUnstructuredGrid and generates on output isosurfaces and/or
 isolines. The exact form of the output depends upon the dimensionality of
 the input data.  Data consisting of 3D cells will generate isosurfaces,
 data consisting of 2D cells will generate isolines, and data with 1D or 0D
 cells will generate isopoints. Combinations of output type are possible if
 the input dimension is mixed.

 To use this filter you must specify one or more contour values.
 You can either use the method SetValue() to specify each contour
 value, or use GenerateValues() to generate a series of evenly
 spaced contours. It is also possible to accelerate the operation of
 this filter (at the cost of extra memory) by using a
 vtkScalarTree. A scalar tree is used to quickly locate cells that
 contain a contour surface. This is especially effective if multiple
 contours are being extracted. If you want to use a scalar tree,
 invoke the method UseScalarTreeOn().


To create an instance of class vtkContourGrid, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkContourGrid
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkContourGrid has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkContourGrid class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>

<LI>  <tt>vtkContourGrid = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetValue (int i, double value)</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetValue (int i)</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetValues (double contourValues)</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNumberOfContours (int number)</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetNumberOfContours ()</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double range[2])</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GenerateValues (int numContours, double rangeStart, double rangeEnd)</tt> -  Methods to set / get contour values.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>long = obj.GetMTime ()</tt> -  Modified GetMTime Because we delegate to vtkContourValues
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetComputeNormals (int )</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of normals. Normal computation is fairly
 expensive in both time and storage. If the output data will be
 processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be
 wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetComputeNormals ()</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of normals. Normal computation is fairly
 expensive in both time and storage. If the output data will be
 processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be
 wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ComputeNormalsOn ()</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of normals. Normal computation is fairly
 expensive in both time and storage. If the output data will be
 processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be
 wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ComputeNormalsOff ()</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of normals. Normal computation is fairly
 expensive in both time and storage. If the output data will be
 processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it may be
 wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetComputeGradients (int )</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of gradients. Gradient computation is
 fairly expensive in both time and storage. Note that if
 ComputeNormals is on, gradients will have to be calculated, but
 will not be stored in the output dataset.  If the output data
 will be processed by filters that modify topology or geometry, it
 may be wise to turn Normals and Gradients off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetComputeGradients ()</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of gradients. Gradient computation is
 fairly expensive in both time and storage. Note that if
 ComputeNormals is on, gradients will have to be calculated, but
 will not be stored in the output dataset.  If the output data

<LI>  <tt>obj.ComputeGradientsOff ()</tt> -  Set/Get the computation of gradients. Gradient computation is
