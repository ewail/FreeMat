\section Usage
 Converts a vtkGraph to a vtkPolyData containing a set of points.

 of the graph have already been filled (perhaps by vtkGraphLayout).
 The vertex data is passed along to the point data.

To create an instance of class vtkGraphToPoints, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGraphToPoints
\endverbatim
