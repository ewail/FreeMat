\section Usage

 Given an unstructured grid on its input this filter generates
 for each data array in point data dictionary (ie an instance of 
 vtkInformationQuadratureSchemeDefinitionVectorKey). This filter 
 has been introduced to facilitate testing of the vtkQuadrature* 
 classes as these cannot operate with the dictionary. This class
 is for testing and should not be used for application development.
