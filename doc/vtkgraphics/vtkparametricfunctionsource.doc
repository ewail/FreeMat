\section Usage
 This class tessellates parametric functions. The user must specify how
 many points in the parametric coordinate directions are required (i.e.,
 the resolution), and the mode to use to generate scalars. 

 .SECTION Thanks
 Andrew Maclean a.maclean@cas.edu.au for creating and contributing the
 class.


To create an instance of class vtkParametricFunctionSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim

 SCALAR_PHASE, the scalar is set to (atan2(v,u)) (in degrees, 0 to 360), this is measured relative to (u_avg,v_avg).
 SCALAR_QUADRANT, the scalar is set to 1, 2, 3 or 4 
   depending upon the quadrant of the point (u,v).
 SCALAR_X, the scalar is set to the x-value. 
 SCALAR_Y, the scalar is set to the y-value. 
 SCALAR_Z, the scalar is set to the z-value. 
 SCALAR_DISTANCE, the scalar is set to (sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)). I.e. distance from the origin.
 SCALAR_FUNCTION_DEFINED, the scalar is set to the value returned from EvaluateScalar().
