\section Usage
 vtkGlyph3D is a filter that copies a geometric representation (called
 a glyph) to every point in the input dataset. The glyph is defined with
 polygonal data from a source filter input. The glyph may be oriented
 along the input vectors or normals, and it may be scaled according to
 scalar data or vector magnitude. More than one glyph may be used by
 creating a table of source objects, each defining a different glyph. If a
 table of glyphs is defined, then the table can be indexed into by using
 either scalar value or vector magnitude.
 
 To use this object you'll have to provide an input dataset and a source
 to define the glyph. Then decide whether you want to scale the glyph and
 how to scale the glyph (using scalar value or vector magnitude). Next
 decide whether you want to orient the glyph, and whether to use the
 vector data or normal data to orient it. Finally, decide whether to use a
 table of glyphs, or just a single glyph. If you use a table of glyphs,
 you'll have to decide whether to index into it with scalar value or with
 vector magnitude.
 

To create an instance of class vtkGlyph3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGlyph3D
