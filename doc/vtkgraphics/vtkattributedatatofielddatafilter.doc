\section Usage
 vtkAttributeDataToFieldDataFilter is a class that maps attribute data into
 field data. Since this filter is a subclass of vtkDataSetAlgorithm,
 the output dataset (whose structure is the same as the input dataset),
 will contain the field data that is generated. The filter will convert
 point and cell attribute data to field data and assign it as point and
 cell field data, replacing any point or field data that was there
 previously. By default, the original non-field point and cell attribute
 data will be passed to the output of the filter, although you can shut
 this behavior down.

To create an instance of class vtkAttributeDataToFieldDataFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkAttributeDataToFieldDataFilter
\endverbatim
