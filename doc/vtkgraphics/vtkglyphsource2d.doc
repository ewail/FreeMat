\section Usage
 vtkGlyphSource2D can generate a family of 2D glyphs each of which lies
 in the x-y plane (i.e., the z-coordinate is zero). The class is a helper 
 class to be used with vtkGlyph2D and vtkXYPlotActor.

 To use this class, specify the glyph type to use and its
 attributes. Attributes include its position (i.e., center point), scale,
 color, and whether the symbol is filled or not (a polygon or closed line
 sequence). You can also put a short line through the glyph running from -x
 to +x (the glyph looks like it's on a line), or a cross.

To create an instance of class vtkGlyphSource2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGlyphSource2D
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkGlyphSource2D has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkGlyphSource2D class.

 to fit in the (1,1) rectangle.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetScale2 (double )</tt> -  Set the scale of optional portions of the glyph (e.g., the
 dash and cross is DashOn() and CrossOn()).

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFilled (int )</tt> -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetFilled ()</tt> -  Specify whether the glyph is filled (a polygon) or not (a
 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.

 closed polygon defined by line segments). This only applies
 to 2D closed glyphs.
