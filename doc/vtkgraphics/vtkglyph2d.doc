\section Usage
 This subclass of vtkGlyph3D is a specialization to 2D. Transformations
 (i.e., translation, scaling, and rotation) are constrained to the plane.
 For example, rotations due to a vector are computed from the x-y
 coordinates of the vector only, and are assumed to occur around the
 z-axis. (See vtkGlyph3D for documentation on the interface to this
 class.)
 

To create an instance of class vtkGlyph2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGlyph2D
\endverbatim
