Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkCylinderSource creates a polygonal cylinder centered at Center;
 The axis of the cylinder is aligned along the global y-axis.
 The height and radius of the cylinder can be specified, as well as the
 number of sides. It is also possible to control whether the cylinder is
 open-ended or capped.

To create an instance of class vtkCylinderSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCylinderSource
\endverbatim
