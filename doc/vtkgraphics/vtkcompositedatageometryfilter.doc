\section Usage
 vtkCompositeDataGeometryFilter applies vtkGeometryFilter to all
 leaves in vtkCompositeDataSet. Place this filter at the end of a
 pipeline before a polydata consumer such as a polydata mapper to extract
 geometry from all blocks and append them to one polydata object.

To create an instance of class vtkCompositeDataGeometryFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCompositeDataGeometryFilter
\endverbatim
