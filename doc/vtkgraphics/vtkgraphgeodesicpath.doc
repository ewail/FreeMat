Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 Serves as a base class for algorithms that trace a geodesic on a 
 polygonal dataset treating it as a graph. ie points connecting the 
 vertices of the graph

To create an instance of class vtkGraphGeodesicPath, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGraphGeodesicPath
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkGraphGeodesicPath has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
