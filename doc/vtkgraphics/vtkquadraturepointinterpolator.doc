\section Usage

 Interpolates each scalar/vector field in a vtkUnstrcturedGrid
 on its input to a specific set of quadrature points. The
 set of quadrature points is specified per array via a 
 dictionary (ie an instance of vtkInformationQuadratureSchemeDefinitionVectorKey). 
 contained in the array. The interpolated fields are placed
 in FieldData along with a set of per cell indexes, that allow 
 random access to a given cells quadrature points.


To create an instance of class vtkQuadraturePointInterpolator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkQuadraturePointInterpolator
\endverbatim
