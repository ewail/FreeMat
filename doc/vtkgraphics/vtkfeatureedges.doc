\section Usage
 vtkFeatureEdges is a filter to extract special types of edges from
 input polygonal data. These edges are either 1) boundary (used by 
 one polygon) or a line cell; 2) non-manifold (used by three or more 
 polygons); 3) feature edges (edges used by two triangles and whose
 dihedral angle > FeatureAngle); or 4) manifold edges (edges used by
 exactly two polygons). These edges may be extracted in any
 combination. Edges may also be "colored" (i.e., scalar values assigned)
 based on edge type. The cell coloring is assigned to the cell data of
 the extracted edges.

To create an instance of class vtkFeatureEdges, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkFeatureEdges
\endverbatim
