\section Usage
 vtkRibbonFilter is a filter to create oriented ribbons from lines defined
 in polygonal dataset. The orientation of the ribbon is along the line 
 segments and perpendicular to "projected" line normals. Projected line 
 normals are the original line normals projected to be perpendicular to 
 the local line segment. An offset angle can be specified to rotate the 
 ribbon with respect to the normal.


To create an instance of class vtkRibbonFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkRibbonFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkRibbonFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
