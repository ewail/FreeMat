Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 Takes as input a polygonal mesh and performs a single source shortest 
 path calculation. Dijkstra's algorithm is used. The implementation is 
 similar to the one described in Introduction to Algorithms (Second Edition)
 by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and 
 Cliff Stein, published by MIT Press and McGraw-Hill. Some minor 
 enhancement are added though. All vertices are not pushed on the heap
 at start, instead a front set is maintained. The heap is implemented as 
 a binary heap. The output of the filter is a set of lines describing 
 the shortest path from StartVertex to EndVertex.


To create an instance of class vtkDijkstraGraphGeodesicPath, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDijkstraGraphGeodesicPath
\endverbatim
