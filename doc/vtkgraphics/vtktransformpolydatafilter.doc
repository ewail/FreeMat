\section Usage
 vtkTransformPolyDataFilter is a filter to transform point
 coordinates and associated point and cell normals and
 vectors. Other point and cell data is passed through the filter
 unchanged. This filter is specialized for polygonal data. See
 vtkTransformFilter for more general data.

 An alternative method of transformation is to use vtkActor's methods
 to scale, rotate, and translate objects. The difference between the
 two methods is that vtkActor's transformation simply effects where
 objects are rendered (via the graphics pipeline), whereas
 vtkTransformPolyDataFilter actually modifies point coordinates in the 
 visualization pipeline. This is necessary for some objects 
 (e.g., vtkProbeFilter) that require point coordinates as input.

To create an instance of class vtkTransformPolyDataFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTransformPolyDataFilter
\endverbatim
