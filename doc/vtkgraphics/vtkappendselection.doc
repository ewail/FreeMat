Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkAppendSelection is a filter that appends one of more selections into
 a single selection.  All selections must have the same content type unless
 AppendByUnion is false.

To create an instance of class vtkAppendSelection, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkAppendSelection
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkAppendSelection has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkAppendSelection class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAppendSelection = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAppendSelection = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetUserManagedInputs (int )</tt> -  UserManagedInputs allows the user to set inputs by number instead of
 using the AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
 SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed with calls
 to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default, UserManagedInputs is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetUserManagedInputs ()</tt> -  UserManagedInputs allows the user to set inputs by number instead of
 using the AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
 SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed with calls
 to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default, UserManagedInputs is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UserManagedInputsOn ()</tt> -  UserManagedInputs allows the user to set inputs by number instead of
 using the AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
 SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed with calls
 to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default, UserManagedInputs is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UserManagedInputsOff ()</tt> -  UserManagedInputs allows the user to set inputs by number instead of
 using the AddInput/RemoveInput functions. Calls to
 SetNumberOfInputs/SetInputByNumber should not be mixed with calls
 to AddInput/RemoveInput. By default, UserManagedInputs is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.AddInput (vtkSelection )</tt> -  Add a dataset to the list of data to append. Should not be
 used when UserManagedInputs is true, use SetInputByNumber instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.RemoveInput (vtkSelection )</tt> -  Remove a dataset from the list of data to append. Should not be
 used when UserManagedInputs is true, use SetInputByNumber (NULL) instead.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNumberOfInputs (int num)</tt> -  Directly set(allocate) number of inputs, should only be used
 when UserManagedInputs is true.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetInputByNumber (int num, vtkSelection input)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetAppendByUnion (int )</tt> -  When set to true, all the selections are combined together to form a single
 vtkSelection output.
 When set to false, the output is a composite selection with 
 input selections as the children of the composite selection. This allows
 for selections with different content types and properties. Default is
 true. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetAppendByUnion ()</tt> -  When set to true, all the selections are combined together to form a single
 vtkSelection output.
 When set to false, the output is a composite selection with 
 input selections as the children of the composite selection. This allows
 for selections with different content types and properties. Default is
 true. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.AppendByUnionOn ()</tt> -  When set to true, all the selections are combined together to form a single
 vtkSelection output.
 When set to false, the output is a composite selection with 
 input selections as the children of the composite selection. This allows
 for selections with different content types and properties. Default is
 true. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.AppendByUnionOff ()</tt> -  When set to true, all the selections are combined together to form a single
 vtkSelection output.
 When set to false, the output is a composite selection with 
 input selections as the children of the composite selection. This allows
 for selections with different content types and properties. Default is
 true.
