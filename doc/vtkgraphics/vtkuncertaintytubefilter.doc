\section Usage
 vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter is a filter that generates ellipsoidal (in cross
 section) tubes that follows a polyline. The input is a vtkPolyData with
 polylines that have associated vector point data. The vector data represents
 the uncertainty of the polyline in the x-y-z directions.


To create an instance of class vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkUncertaintyTubeFilter
\endverbatim
