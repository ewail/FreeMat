\section Usage
 vtkEllipticalButtonSource creates a ellipsoidal shaped button with
 texture coordinates suitable for application of a texture map. This
 provides a way to make nice looking 3D buttons. The buttons are
 represented as vtkPolyData that includes texture coordinates and
 normals. The button lies in the x-y plane.

 To use this class you must define the major and minor axes lengths of an
 ellipsoid (expressed as width (x), height (y) and depth (z)). The button
 has a rectangular mesh region in the center with texture coordinates that
 range smoothly from (0,1). (This flat region is called the texture
 region.) The outer, curved portion of the button (called the shoulder) has
 texture coordinates set to a user specified value (by default (0,0).
 (This results in coloring the button curve the same color as the (s,t)
 location of the texture map.) The resolution in the radial direction, the
 texture region, and the shoulder region must also be set. The button can
 be moved by specifying an origin.


To create an instance of class vtkEllipticalButtonSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkEllipticalButtonSource
\endverbatim

<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRadialRatio (double )</tt> -  Set/Get the radial ratio. This is the measure of the radius of the
 outer ellipsoid to the inner ellipsoid of the button. The outer
 ellipsoid is the boundary of the button defined by the height and
 width. The inner ellipsoid circumscribes the texture region. Larger
 RadialRatio's cause the button to be more rounded (and the texture
 region to be smaller); smaller ratios produce sharply curved shoulders
 with a larger texture region.
