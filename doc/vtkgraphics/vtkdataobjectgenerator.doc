Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkDataObjectGenerator parses a string and produces dataobjects from the
 dataobject template names it sees in the string. For example, if the string
 contains "ID1" the generator will create a vtkImageData. "UF1", "RG1", 
 "SG1", "PD1", and "UG1" will produce vtkUniformGrid, vtkRectilinearGrid,
 vtkStructuredGrid, vtkPolyData and vtkUnstructuredGrid respectively.
 "PD2" will produce an alternate vtkPolyData. You 
 can compose composite datasets from the atomic ones listed above
 by placing them within one of the two composite dataset identifiers
 - "MB{}" or "HB[]". "MB{ ID1 PD1 MB{} }" for example will create a 
 vtkMultiBlockDataSet consisting of three blocks: image data, poly data, 
 multi-block (empty). Hierarchical Box data sets additionally require
 the notion of groups, declared within "()" braces, to specify AMR depth.
 "HB[ (UF1)(UF1)(UF1) ]" will create a vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet representing
 an octree that is three levels deep, in which the firstmost cell in each level
 is refined.

To create an instance of class vtkDataObjectGenerator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDataObjectGenerator
\endverbatim
