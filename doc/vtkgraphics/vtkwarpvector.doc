\section Usage
 vtkWarpVector is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving
 points along vector times the scale factor. Useful for showing flow
 profiles or mechanical deformation.

 The filter passes both its point data and cell data to its output.

To create an instance of class vtkWarpVector, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkWarpVector
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkWarpVector has several methods that can be used.
