\section Usage
 vtkShrinkPolyData shrinks cells composing a polygonal dataset (e.g., 
 vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips) towards their centroid. 
 The centroid of a cell is computed as the average position of the
 cell points. Shrinking results in disconnecting the cells from
 one another. The output dataset type of this filter is polygonal data.

 During execution the filter passes its input cell data to its
 output. Point data attributes are copied to the points created during the
 shrinking process.

To create an instance of class vtkShrinkPolyData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkShrinkPolyData
\endverbatim
