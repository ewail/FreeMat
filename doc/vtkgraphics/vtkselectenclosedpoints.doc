\section Usage
 vtkSelectEnclosedPoints is a filter that evaluates all the input points to
 determine whether they are in an enclosed surface. The filter produces a
 (0,1) mask (in the form of a vtkDataArray) that indicates whether points 
 are outside (mask value=0) or inside (mask value=1) a provided surface.
 (The name of the output vtkDataArray is "SelectedPointsArray".)

 After running the filter, it is possible to query it as to whether a point 
 is inside/outside by invoking the IsInside(ptId) method.

To create an instance of class vtkSelectEnclosedPoints, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSelectEnclosedPoints
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkSelectEnclosedPoints has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkSelectEnclosedPoints class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkSelectEnclosedPoints = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkSelectEnclosedPoints = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSurface (vtkPolyData pd)</tt> -  Set the surface to be used to test for containment. Two methods are 
 provided: one directly for vtkPolyData, and one for the output of a
 filter.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSurfaceConnection (vtkAlgorithmOutput algOutput)</tt> -  Set the surface to be used to test for containment. Two methods are 
 provided: one directly for vtkPolyData, and one for the output of a
 filter.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPolyData = obj.GetSurface ()</tt> -  Return a pointer to the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPolyData = obj.GetSurface (vtkInformationVector sourceInfo)</tt> -  Return a pointer to the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetInsideOut (int )</tt> -  By default, points inside the surface are marked inside or sent to
 the output. If InsideOut is on, then the points outside the surface
 are marked inside.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.InsideOutOn ()</tt> -  By default, points inside the surface are marked inside or sent to
 the output. If InsideOut is on, then the points outside the surface
 are marked inside.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.InsideOutOff ()</tt> -  By default, points inside the surface are marked inside or sent to
 the output. If InsideOut is on, then the points outside the surface
 are marked inside.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetInsideOut ()</tt> -  By default, points inside the surface are marked inside or sent to
 the output. If InsideOut is on, then the points outside the surface
 are marked inside.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetCheckSurface (int )</tt> -  Specify whether to check the surface for closure. If on, then the
 algorithm first checks to see if the surface is closed and manifold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CheckSurfaceOn ()</tt> -  Specify whether to check the surface for closure. If on, then the
 algorithm first checks to see if the surface is closed and manifold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CheckSurfaceOff ()</tt> -  Specify whether to check the surface for closure. If on, then the
 algorithm first checks to see if the surface is closed and manifold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetCheckSurface ()</tt> -  Specify whether to check the surface for closure. If on, then the
 algorithm first checks to see if the surface is closed and manifold.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsInside (vtkIdType inputPtId)</tt> -  Query an input point id as to whether it is inside or outside. Note that
 the result requires that the filter execute first.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetTolerance (double )</tt> -  Specify the tolerance on the intersection. The tolerance is expressed
 as a fraction of the bounding box of the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetToleranceMinValue ()</tt> -  Specify the tolerance on the intersection. The tolerance is expressed
 as a fraction of the bounding box of the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetToleranceMaxValue ()</tt> -  Specify the tolerance on the intersection. The tolerance is expressed
 as a fraction of the bounding box of the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetTolerance ()</tt> -  Specify the tolerance on the intersection. The tolerance is expressed
 as a fraction of the bounding box of the enclosing surface.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Initialize (vtkPolyData surface)</tt> -  This is a backdoor that can be used to test many points for containment.
 First initialize the instance, then repeated calls to IsInsideSurface()
 can be used without rebuilding the search structures. The complete
 method releases memory.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsInsideSurface (double x, double y, double z)</tt> -  This is a backdoor that can be used to test many points for containment.
 First initialize the instance, then repeated calls to IsInsideSurface()
 can be used without rebuilding the search structures. The complete
 method releases memory.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsInsideSurface (double x[3])</tt> -  This is a backdoor that can be used to test many points for containment.
 First initialize the instance, then repeated calls to IsInsideSurface()
 can be used without rebuilding the search structures. The complete
 method releases memory.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Complete ()</tt> -  This is a backdoor that can be used to test many points for containment.
 First initialize the instance, then repeated calls to IsInsideSurface()
 can be used without rebuilding the search structures. The complete
 method releases memory.
