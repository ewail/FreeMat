\section Usage
 vtkHyperStreamline is a filter that integrates through a tensor field to 
 generate a hyperstreamline. The integration is along the maximum eigenvector
 and the cross section of the hyperstreamline is defined by the two other
 eigenvectors. Thus the shape of the hyperstreamline is "tube-like", with 
 the cross section being elliptical. Hyperstreamlines are used to visualize
 tensor fields.

 The starting point of a hyperstreamline can be defined in one of two ways. 
 First, you may specify an initial position. This is a x-y-z global 
 coordinate. The second option is to specify a starting location. This is 
 cellId, subId, and  cell parametric coordinates.

 The integration of the hyperstreamline occurs through the major eigenvector 
 field. IntegrationStepLength controls the step length within each cell 
 (i.e., this is the fraction of the cell length). The length of the 
 hyperstreamline is controlled by MaximumPropagationDistance. This parameter
 is the length of the hyperstreamline in units of distance. The tube itself 
 is composed of many small sub-tubes - NumberOfSides controls the number of 
 sides in the tube, and StepLength controls the length of the sub-tubes.

 Because hyperstreamlines are often created near regions of singularities, it
 is possible to control the scaling of the tube cross section by using a 
 logarithmic scale. Use LogScalingOn to turn this capability on. The Radius 
 value controls the initial radius of the tube.

To create an instance of class vtkHyperStreamline, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
