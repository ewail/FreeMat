Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 This filter extracts the point data from a time sequence and specified index
 and creates an output of the same type as the input but with Points 
 containing "number of time steps" points; the point and PointData 
 corresponding to the PointIndex are extracted at each time step and added to
 the output.  A PointData array is added called "Time" (or "TimeData" if
 there is already an array called "Time"), which is the time at each index.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractDataOverTime, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkExtractDataOverTime
\endverbatim
