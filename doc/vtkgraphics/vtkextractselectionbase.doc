\section Usage
 vtkExtractSelectionBase is an abstract base class for all extract selection
 filters. It defines some properties common to all extract selection filters.

To create an instance of class vtkExtractSelectionBase, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkExtractSelectionBase
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkExtractSelectionBase has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkExtractSelectionBase class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkExtractSelectionBase = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkExtractSelectionBase = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSelectionConnection (vtkAlgorithmOutput algOutput)</tt> -  This flag tells the extraction filter not to convert the selected
 output into an unstructured grid, but instead to produce a vtkInsidedness
 array and add it to the input dataset. Default value is false(0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPreserveTopology (int )</tt> -  This flag tells the extraction filter not to convert the selected
 output into an unstructured grid, but instead to produce a vtkInsidedness
 array and add it to the input dataset. Default value is false(0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetPreserveTopology ()</tt> -  This flag tells the extraction filter not to convert the selected
 output into an unstructured grid, but instead to produce a vtkInsidedness
 array and add it to the input dataset. Default value is false(0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.PreserveTopologyOn ()</tt> -  This flag tells the extraction filter not to convert the selected
 output into an unstructured grid, but instead to produce a vtkInsidedness
 array and add it to the input dataset. Default value is false(0).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.PreserveTopologyOff ()</tt> -  This flag tells the extraction filter not to convert the selected
 output into an unstructured grid, but instead to produce a vtkInsidedness
 array and add it to the input dataset. Default value is false(0).
 </LI>
