\section Usage
 vtkOutlineCornerFilter is a filter that generates wireframe outline corners of any 
 data set. The outline consists of the eight corners of the dataset 
 bounding box.

To create an instance of class vtkOutlineCornerFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkOutlineCornerFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkOutlineCornerFilter has several methods that can be used.

<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkOutlineCornerFilter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkOutlineCornerFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetCornerFactor (double )</tt> -  Set/Get the factor that controls the relative size of the corners
 to the length of the corresponding bounds
 </LI>
