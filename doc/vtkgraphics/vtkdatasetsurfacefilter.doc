Section: \ref sec_vtkgraphics "Visualization Toolkit Graphics Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter is a faster version of vtkGeometry filter, but it 
 does not have an option to select bounds.  It may use more memory than
 vtkGeometryFilter.  It only has one option: whether to use triangle strips 
 when the input type is structured.

To create an instance of class vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetUseStrips (int )</tt> -  When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with
 triangle strips.  This should render faster and use less memory, but no
 cell data is copied.  By default, UseStrips is Off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetUseStrips ()</tt> -  When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with
 triangle strips.  This should render faster and use less memory, but no
 cell data is copied.  By default, UseStrips is Off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UseStripsOn ()</tt> -  When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with
 triangle strips.  This should render faster and use less memory, but no
 cell data is copied.  By default, UseStrips is Off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UseStripsOff ()</tt> -  When input is structured data, this flag will generate faces with
 triangle strips.  This should render faster and use less memory, but no
 cell data is copied.  By default, UseStrips is Off.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPieceInvariant (int )</tt> -  If PieceInvariant is true, vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter requests
 1 ghost level from input in order to remove internal surface
 that are between processes. False by default.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetPieceInvariant ()</tt> -  If PieceInvariant is true, vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter requests
 1 ghost level from input in order to remove internal surface
 that are between processes. False by default.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPassThroughCellIds (int )</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the
 input cells.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetPassThroughCellIds ()</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the
 input cells.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.PassThroughCellIdsOn ()</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the
 input cells.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.PassThroughCellIdsOff ()</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the
 input cells.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPassThroughPointIds (int )</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the
 input cells.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetPassThroughPointIds ()</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that 
 holds the cell index of the original 3D cell that produced each output
 cell. This is useful for cell picking. The default is off to conserve 
 memory. Note that PassThroughCellIds will be ignored if UseStrips is on,
 since in that case each tringle strip can represent more than on of the

<LI>  <tt>obj.PassThroughPointIdsOn ()</tt> -  If on, the output polygonal dataset will have a celldata array that

<LI>  <tt>int = obj.StructuredExecute (vtkDataSet input, vtkPolyData output, int ext32, int wholeExt32)</tt> -  Direct access methods that can be used to use the this class as an
 algorithm without using it as a filter.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.UnstructuredGridExecute (vtkDataSet input, vtkPolyData output)</tt> -  Direct access methods that can be used to use the this class as an
 algorithm without using it as a filter.
