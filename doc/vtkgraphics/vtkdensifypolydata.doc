\section Usage
 The filter takes any polygonal data as input and will tessellate cells that 
 are planar polygons present by fanning out triangles from its centroid. 
 Other cells are simply passed through to the output.  PointData, if present,
 is interpolated via linear interpolation. CellData for any tessellated cell
 is simply copied over from its parent cell. Planar polygons are assumed to 
 be convex. Funny things will happen if they are not.
 
 The number of subdivisions can be controlled by the parameter
 NumberOfSubdivisions.

To create an instance of class vtkDensifyPolyData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDensifyPolyData
\endverbatim
