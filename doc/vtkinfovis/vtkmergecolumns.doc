Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkMergeColumns replaces two columns in a table with a single column
 containing data in both columns.  The columns are set using

   SetInputArrayToProcess(0, 0, 0, vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_ROWS, "col1")

 and

   SetInputArrayToProcess(1, 0, 0, vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_ROWS, "col2")

 where "col1" and "col2" are the names of the columns to merge.
 The user may also specify the name of the merged column.
 The arrays must be of the same type.
 If the arrays are numeric, the values are summed in the merged column.
 If the arrays are strings, the values are concatenated.  The strings are
 separated by a space if they are both nonempty.

To create an instance of class vtkMergeColumns, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkMergeColumns
\endverbatim
