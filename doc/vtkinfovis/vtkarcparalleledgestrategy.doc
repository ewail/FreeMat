Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
 Parallel edges are drawn as arcs, and self-loops are drawn as ovals.
 When only one edge connects two vertices it is drawn as a straight line.

To create an instance of class vtkArcParallelEdgeStrategy, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkArcParallelEdgeStrategy
\endverbatim

<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkArcParallelEdgeStrategy = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
