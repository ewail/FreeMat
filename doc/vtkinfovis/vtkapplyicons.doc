\section Usage
 vtkApplyIcons performs a iconing of the dataset using default icons,
 lookup tables, annotations, and/or a selection. The output is a
 vtkIntArray containing the icon index for each
 element in the dataset. The first input is the dataset to be iconed, which
 may be a vtkTable, vtkGraph subclass, or vtkDataSet subclass.

 The second (optional) input is a vtkAnnotationLayers object, which stores
 a list of annotation layers, with each layer holding a list of
 vtkAnnotation objects. The annotation specifies a subset of data along with
 other properties, including icon. For annotations with icon properties,
 this algorithm will use the icon index of annotated elements,
 using a "top one wins" strategy.

 The third (optional) input is a vtkSelection object, meant for specifying
 the current selection. You can control the icon of the selection, or whether
 there is a set of selected icons at a particular offset in the icon sheet.

 The algorithm takes an input array, specified with
 SetInputArrayToProcess(0, 0, 0, vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS, name)
 This sets data arrays to use to icon the data with
 the associated lookup table. For vtkGraph and vtkTable inputs, you would use
 FIELD_ASSOCIATION_VERTICES, FIELD_ASSOCIATION_EDGES, or
 FIELD_ASSOCIATION_ROWS as appropriate. The icon array will be added to the same
 set of attributes that the input array came from. If there is no input array,
 the icon array will be applied to the attributes associated with the
 AttributeType parameter.

 Icons are assigned with the following priorities:
 <ol>
 <li> If an item is part of the selection, it is glyphed with that icon.
 <li> Otherwise, if the item is part of an annotation, it is glyphed
      with the icon of the final (top) annotation in the set of layers.
 <li> Otherwise, if a lookup table is used, it is glyphed using the
      lookup table icon for the data value of the element.
 <li> Otherwise it will be glyphed with the default icon.
 </ol>

To create an instance of class vtkApplyIcons, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkApplyIcons

\section Methods
The class vtkApplyIcons has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkApplyIcons class.

<LI>  <tt>obj.SetIconType (double v, int icon)</tt> -  Edits the lookup table to use for point icons. This is only used if
 input array 0 is set and UsePointLookupTable is on.
