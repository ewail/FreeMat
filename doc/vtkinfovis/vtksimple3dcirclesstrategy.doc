\section Usage
 Places vertices on circles depending on the graph vertices hierarchy level.
 The source graph could be vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph or vtkDirectedGraph if MarkedStartPoints array was added.
 The algorithm collects the standalone points, too and take them to a separated circle. If method is FixedRadiusMethod,
 the radius of the circles will be equal. If method is FixedDistanceMethod, the distance beetwen the points on circles will
 be equal.

 In first step initial points are searched. A point is initial, if its in degree equal zero and out degree is greater than zero (or
 marked by MarkedStartVertices and out degree is greater than zero). Independent vertices (in and out degree equal zero) are collected
 separatelly. In second step the hierarchical level is generated for every vertex. In third step the hierarchical order is generated.
 If a vertex has no hierarchical level and it is not independent, the graph has loop so the algorithm exit with error message. Finally
 the vertices positions are calculated by the hierarchical order and by the vertices hierarchy levels.
