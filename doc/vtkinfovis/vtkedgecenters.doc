\section Usage
 vtkEdgeCenters is a filter that takes as input any graph and 
 generates on output points at the center of the cells in the dataset.
 These points can be used for placing glyphs (vtkGlyph3D) or labeling 
 (vtkLabeledDataMapper). (The center is the parametric center of the
 cell, not necessarily the geometric or bounding box center.) The edge
 attributes will be associated with the points on output.
 

To create an instance of class vtkEdgeCenters, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkEdgeCenters
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkEdgeCenters has several methods that can be used.
