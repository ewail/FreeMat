\section Usage
 vtkTulipReader reads in files in the Tulip format.
 Definition of the Tulip file format can be found online at:
 http://tulip.labri.fr/tlpformat.php
 An example is the following
 <code>
 (nodes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
 (edge 0 0 1)
 (edge 1 1 2)
 (edge 2 2 3)
 (edge 3 3 4)
 (edge 4 4 5)
 (edge 5 5 6)
 (edge 6 6 7)
 (edge 7 7 8)
 (edge 8 8 9)
 (edge 9 9 0)
 (edge 10 0 5)
 (edge 11 2 7)
 (edge 12 4 9)
 </code>
 where "nodes" defines all the nodes ids in the graph, and "edge"
 is a triple of edge id, source vertex id, and target vertex id.
 The graph is read in as undirected graph.
 NOTE: This currently only supports reading connectivity information.
