\section Usage
 vtkChacoGraphReader reads in files in the Chaco format into a vtkGraph.
 An example is the following
 <code>
 10 13
 2 6 10
 1 3
 2 4 8
 3 5
 4 6 10
 1 5 7
 6 8
 3 7 9
 8 10
 1 5 9
 </code>
 The first line specifies the number of vertices and edges
 in the graph. Each additional line contains the vertices adjacent
 to a particular vertex.  In this example, vertex 1 is adjacent to
 2, 6 and 10, vertex 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, etc.  Since Chaco ids
 start at 1 and VTK ids start at 0, the vertex ids in the vtkGraph
 will be 1 less than the Chaco ids.

To create an instance of class vtkChacoGraphReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkChacoGraphReader
\endverbatim
