\section Usage
 This class takes as input an optional vtkTable on port LEARN_PARAMETERS 
 specifying initial  set(s) of cluster values of the following form:  
 <pre>
           K     | Col1            |  ...    | ColN    
      -----------+-----------------+---------+---------------
           M     |clustCoord(1, 1) |  ...    | clustCoord(1, N)
           M     |clustCoord(2, 1) |  ...    | clustCoord(2, N)
           .     |       .         |   .     |        .

           M     |clustCoord(M, 1) |  ...    | clustCoord(M, N)
           L     |clustCoord(1, 1) |  ...    | clustCoord(1, N)
           L     |clustCoord(2, 1) |  ...    | clustCoord(2, N)
           .     |       .         |   .     |        .

 Because the desired value of K is often not known in advance and the 
 results of the algorithm are dependent on the initial cluster centers, 
 we provide a mechanism for the user to test multiple runs or sets of cluster centers
 within a single call to the Learn phase.  The first column of the table identifies 
 the number of clusters K in the particular run (the entries in this column should be 
 of type vtkIdType), while the remaining columns are a 
 subset of the columns contained in the table on port INPUT_DATA.  We require that 
 all user specified clusters be of the same dimension N and consequently, that the 
 LEARN_PARAMETERS table have N+1 columns. Due to this restriction, only one request
 can be processed for each call to the Learn phase and subsequent requests are 
 silently ignored. Note that, if the first column of the LEARN_PARAMETERS table is not 
 of type vtkIdType, then the table will be ignored and a single run will be performed using
 the first DefaultNumberOfClusters input data observations as initial cluster centers.

 When the user does not supply an initial set of clusters, then the first 
 DefaultNumberOfClusters input data observations are used as initial cluster 
 centers and a single run is performed.


 This class provides the following functionalities, depending on the 
 mode it is executed in:
 * Learn: calculates new cluster centers for each run.  The output metadata on 
   port OUTPUT_MODEL is a multiblock dataset containing at a minimum
   one vtkTable with columns specifying the following for each run:
   the run ID, number of clusters, number of iterations required for convergence, 
   total error associated with the cluster (sum of squared Euclidean distance from each observation
   to its nearest cluster center), the cardinality of the cluster, and the new
   cluster coordinates.

 *Derive:  An additional vtkTable is stored in the multiblock dataset output on port OUTPUT_MODEL.
   This table contains columns that store for each run: the runID, number of clusters, 
   total error for all clusters in the run, local rank, and global rank.
   The local rank is computed by comparing squared Euclidean errors of all runs with
   the same number of clusters.  The global rank is computed analagously across all runs.

 * Assess: This requires a multiblock dataset (as computed from Learn and Derive) on input port INPUT_MODEL
   and tabular data on input port INPUT_DATA that contains column names matching those
   of the tables on input port INPUT_MODEL. The assess mode reports the closest cluster center
   and associated squared Euclidean distance of each observation in port INPUT_DATA's table to the cluster centers for
   each run in the multiblock dataset provided on port INPUT_MODEL.
  
 The code can handle a wide variety of data types as it operates on vtkAbstractArrays 
 and is not limited to vtkDataArrays.  A default distance functor that
 computes the sum of the squares of the Euclidean distance between two objects is provided 
 (vtkKMeansDistanceFunctor). The default distance functor can be overridden to use alternative distance metrics.
