\section Usage
 Given a selection of pairs of columns of interest, this class provides the
 following functionalities, depending on the execution mode it is executed in:
 * Learn: calculate means, unbiased variance and covariance estimators of
   column pairs, and corresponding linear regressions and linear correlation 
   coefficient. More precisely, Learn calculates the sums; if \p finalize
   is set to true (default), the final statistics are calculated with the 
   function CalculateFromSums. Otherwise, only raw sums are output; this 
   option is made for efficient parallel calculations.
   Note that CalculateFromSums is a static function, so that it can be used
   directly with no need to instantiate a vtkCorrelativeStatistics object.
 * Assess: given two data vectors X and Y with the same number of entries as
   input in port INPUT_DATA, and reference means, variances, and covariance, along
   with an acceptable threshold t>1, assess all pairs of values of (X,Y) 
   whose relative PDF (assuming a bivariate Gaussian model) is below t.
