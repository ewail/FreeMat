Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
  This class does exactly the same this as vtkExtractHistogram2D,
  but does it in a multi-process environment.  After each node
  computes their own local histograms, this class does an AllReduce
  that distributes the sum of all local histograms onto each node.


To create an instance of class vtkPExtractHistogram2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPExtractHistogram2D
\endverbatim
