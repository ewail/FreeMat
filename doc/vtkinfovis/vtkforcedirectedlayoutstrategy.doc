\section Usage
 Lays out a graph in 2D or 3D using a force-directed algorithm.
 The user may specify whether to layout the graph randomly initially,
 the bounds, the number of dimensions (2 or 3), and the cool-down rate.

 .SECTION Thanks
 Thanks to Brian Wylie for adding functionality for allowing this layout
 to be incremental.

To create an instance of class vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkForceDirectedLayoutStrategy
\endverbatim
\section Methods
