\section Usage

 Creates a vtkGraph using one or two vtkSQLQuery's.  The first (required)
 query must have one row for each arc in the graph.
 The query must have two columns which represent the source and target
 node ids.

 The second (optional) query has one row for each node in the graph.
 The table must have a field whose values match those in the arc table.
 If the node table is not given, 
 a node will be created for each unique source or target identifier 
 in the arc table.

 The source, target, and node ID fields must be of the same type, 
 and must be either vtkStringArray or a subclass of vtkDataArray.

 All columns in the queries, including the source, target, and node index
 fields, are copied into the arc data and node data of the resulting
 vtkGraph.  If the node query is not given, the node data will contain
 a single "id" column with the same type as the source/target id arrays.

 If parallel arcs are collected, not all the arc data is not copied into 
 the output.  Only the source and target id arrays will be transferred.
 An additional vtkIdTypeArray column called "weight" is created which 
 contains the number of times each arc appeared in the input.

 If the node query contains positional data, the user may specify the
 names of these fields.
 These arrays must be data arrays.  The z-coordinate array is optional,
 and if not given the z-coordinates are set to zero.

To create an instance of class vtkSQLGraphReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkSQLGraphReader
