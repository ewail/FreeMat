\section Usage
 This class is a shell for many edge layout strategies which may be set
 using the SetLayoutStrategy() function.  The layout strategies do the
 actual work.

To create an instance of class vtkEdgeLayout, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkEdgeLayout
\endverbatim
\section Methods
