\section Usage
 vtkPDescriptiveStatistics is vtkDescriptiveStatistics subclass for parallel datasets.
 It learns and derives the global statistical model on each node, but assesses each 
 individual data points on the node that owns it.

To create an instance of class vtkPDescriptiveStatistics, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPDescriptiveStatistics
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPDescriptiveStatistics has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkPDescriptiveStatistics class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPDescriptiveStatistics = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPDescriptiveStatistics = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController )</tt> -  Get/Set the multiprocess controller. If no controller is set,
 single process is assumed.
