Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkSquarifyLayoutStrategy partitions the space for child vertices into regions
 that use all avaliable space and are as close to squares as possible.
 The algorithm also takes into account the relative vertex size.

 .SECTION Thanks
 The squarified tree map algorithm comes from:
 Bruls, D.M., C. Huizing, J.J. van Wijk. Squarified Treemaps.

To create an instance of class vtkSquarifyLayoutStrategy, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSquarifyLayoutStrategy
\endverbatim
