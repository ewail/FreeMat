 vtkStringArray.

 The output array will be of type vtkTypeUInt64Array.

To create an instance of class vtkStringToTimePoint, simply

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkStringToTimePoint class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkStringToTimePoint = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkStringToTimePoint = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOutputArrayName (string )</tt> -  The name of the output array.
 If this is not specified, the name will be the same as the input
 array name with either " [to datetime]", " [to date]", or " [to time]"
 appended.
