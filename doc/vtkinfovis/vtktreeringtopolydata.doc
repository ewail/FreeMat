<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
 This algorithm requires that the vtkTreeRingLayout filter has already
 been applied to the data in order to create the quadruple array 
 (start angle, end angle, inner radius, outer radius) of bounds 
 for each vertex of the tree.

To create an instance of class vtkTreeRingToPolyData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTreeRingToPolyData
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTreeRingToPolyData has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTreeRingToPolyData class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTreeRingToPolyData = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTreeRingToPolyData = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSectorsArrayName (string name)</tt> -  Define a shrink percentage for each of the sectors.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetShrinkPercentage (double )</tt> -  Define a shrink percentage for each of the sectors.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetShrinkPercentage ()</tt> -  Define a shrink percentage for each of the sectors.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.FillInputPortInformation (int port, vtkInformation info)</tt>
 </LI>
</UL>
