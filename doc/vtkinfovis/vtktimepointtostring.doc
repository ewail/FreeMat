\section Usage

 vtkTimePointToString is a filter for converting a timestamp array
 into string array using one of the formats defined in vtkTimePointUtility.h.

 Use SetInputArrayToProcess to indicate the array to process.  
 This array must be an unsigned 64-bit integer array for 
 DATETIME formats, and may be either an unsigned 32-bit or 
 unsigned 64-bit array for DATE and TIME formats.

 If the new array name is not specified, the array name will be
 the old name appended by " [to string]".

To create an instance of class vtkTimePointToString, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTimePointToString
\endverbatim

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTimePointToString = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetISO8601Format (int )</tt> -  The format to use when converting the timestamp to a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetISO8601Format ()</tt> -  The format to use when converting the timestamp to a string.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOutputArrayName (string )</tt> -  The name of the output array.
 If this is not specified, the name will be the input array name with
 " [to string]" appended to it.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetOutputArrayName ()</tt> -  The name of the output array.
