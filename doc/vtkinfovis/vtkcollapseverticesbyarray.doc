\section Usage
 vtkCollapseVerticesByArray is a class which collapses the graph using
 a vertex array as the key. So if the graph has vertices sharing common
 traits then this class combines all these vertices into one. This class
 does not perform aggregation on vertex data but allow to do so for edge data.
 Users can choose one or more edge data arrays for aggregation using
 AddAggregateEdgeArray function.
