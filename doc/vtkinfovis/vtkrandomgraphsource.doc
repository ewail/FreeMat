Section: \ref sec_vtkinfovis "Visualization Toolkit Infovis Classes"
\section Usage
 Generates a graph with a specified number of vertices, with the density of
 edges specified by either an exact number of edges or the probability of
 an edge.  You may additionally specify whether to begin with a random
 tree (which enforces graph connectivity).


To create an instance of class vtkRandomGraphSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkRandomGraphSource
\endverbatim
