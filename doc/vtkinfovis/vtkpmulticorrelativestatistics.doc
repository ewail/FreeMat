\section Usage
 vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics is vtkMultiCorrelativeStatistics subclass for parallel datasets.
 It learns and derives the global statistical model on each node, but assesses each 
 individual data points on the node that owns it.

To create an instance of class vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPMultiCorrelativeStatistics = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController )</tt> -  Get/Set the multiprocess controller. If no controller is set,
 single process is assumed.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.GetController ()</tt> -  Get/Set the multiprocess controller. If no controller is set,
