\section Usage
 vtkCubeAxesActor2D is a composite actor that draws three axes of the 
 bounding box of an input dataset. The axes include labels and titles
 for the x-y-z axes. The algorithm selects the axes that are on the 
 "exterior" of the bounding box, exterior as determined from examining
 outer edges of the bounding box in projection (display) space. Alternatively,
 the edges closest to the viewer (i.e., camera position) can be drawn.
 
 To use this object you must define a bounding box and the camera used
 to render the vtkCubeAxesActor2D. The camera is used to control the 
 scaling and position of the vtkCubeAxesActor2D so that it fits in the
 viewport and always remains visible.)

 The font property of the axes titles and labels can be modified through the
 AxisTitleTextProperty and AxisLabelTextProperty attributes. You may also
 use the GetXAxisActor2D, GetYAxisActor2D or GetZAxisActor2D methods 
 to access each individual axis actor to modify their font properties.

 The bounding box to use is defined in one of three ways. First, if the Input
 ivar is defined, then the input dataset's bounds is used. If the Input is 
 not defined, and the Prop (superclass of all actors) is defined, then the
 Prop's bounds is used. If neither the Input or Prop is defined, then the
 Bounds instance variable (an array of six doubles) is used.
 

To create an instance of class vtkCubeAxesActor2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCubeAxesActor2D
