\section Usage
 vtkVideoSource is a superclass for video input interfaces for VTK.
 The goal is to provide an interface which is very similar to the
 interface of a VCR, where the 'tape' is an internal frame buffer
 capable of holding a preset number of video frames.  Specialized
 versions of this class record input from various video input sources.
 This base class records input from a noise source.

To create an instance of class vtkVideoSource, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkVideoSource
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkVideoSource has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkVideoSource class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkVideoSource = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkVideoSource = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Record ()</tt> -  Record incoming video at the specified FrameRate.  The recording
 continues indefinitely until Stop() is called. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Play ()</tt> -  Play through the 'tape' sequentially at the specified frame rate.
 If you have just finished Recoding, you should call Rewind() first.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Stop ()</tt> -  Stop recording or playing.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Rewind ()</tt> -  Rewind to the frame with the earliest timestamp.  Record operations
 will start on the following frame, therefore if you want to re-record
 over this frame you must call Seek(-1) before calling Grab() or Record().
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.FastForward ()</tt> -  FastForward to the last frame that was recorded (i.e. to the frame
 that has the most recent timestamp).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Seek (int n)</tt> -  Seek forwards or backwards by the specified number of frames
 (positive is forward, negative is backward).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Grab ()</tt> -  Grab a single video frame.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetRecording ()</tt> -  Are we in record mode? (record mode and play mode are mutually
 exclusive).

<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetPlaying ()</tt> -  Are we in play mode? (record mode and play mode are mutually
 exclusive).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFrameSize (int x, int y, int z)</tt> -  Set the full-frame size.  This must be an allowed size for the device,
 the device may either refuse a request for an illegal frame size or
 automatically choose a new frame size.
 The default is usually 320x240x1, but can be device specific.  
 The 'depth' should always be 1 (unless you have a device that
 can handle 3D acquisition).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetFrameSize (int dim[3])</tt> -  Set the full-frame size.  This must be an allowed size for the device,
 the device may either refuse a request for an illegal frame size or

 The default is usually 320x240x1, but can be device specific.  
 The 'depth' should always be 1 (unless you have a device that
 can handle 3D acquisition).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj. GetFrameSize ()</tt> -  Set the full-frame size.  This must be an allowed size for the device,
 the device may either refuse a request for an illegal frame size or
