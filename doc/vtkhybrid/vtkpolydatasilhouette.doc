\section Usage
 vtkPolyDataSilhouette extracts a subset of a polygonal mesh edges to
 generate an outline (silhouette) of the corresponding 3D object. In
 addition, this filter can also extracts sharp edges (aka feature angles).
 In order to use this filter you must specify the a point of view (origin) or
 a direction (vector).  given this direction or origin, a silhouette is
 generated wherever the surface's normal is orthogonal to the view direction.


To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataSilhouette, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPolyDataSilhouette
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPolyDataSilhouette has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
