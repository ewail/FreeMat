Section: \ref sec_vtkhybrid "Visualization Toolkit Hybrid Classes"
\section Usage
 Match two surfaces using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm.
 The core of the algorithm is to match each vertex in one surface with 
 the closest surface point on the other, then apply the transformation
 that modify one surface to best match the other (in a least square sense).
 This has to be iterated to get proper convergence of the surfaces.
 .SECTION Note
 Use vtkTransformPolyDataFilter to apply the resulting ICP transform to 
 your data. You might also set it to your actor's user transform.
 .SECTION Note
 This class makes use of vtkLandmarkTransform internally to compute the
 best fit. Use the GetLandmarkTransform member to get a pointer to that
 transform and set its parameters. You might, for example, constrain the
 number of degrees of freedom of the solution (i.e. rigid body, similarity,
 etc.) by checking the vtkLandmarkTransform documentation for its SetMode
 member.

To create an instance of class vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform
\endverbatim
