<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkhybrid "Visualization Toolkit Hybrid Classes"
\section Usage
 This filter reads LS-Dyna databases.

 The Set/GetFileName() routines are actually wrappers around the
 Set/GetDatabaseDirectory() members; the actual filename you choose is
 irrelevant -- only the directory name is used.  This is done in order to
 accommodate ParaView.

 Note that this reader produces 7 output meshes.
 These meshes are required as several attributes are defined on subsets
 of the mesh.  Below is a list of meshes in the order they are output and
 an explanation of which attributes are unique to each mesh:
 - solid (3D) elements: number of integration points are different than 2D
 - thick shell elements: number of integration points are different than 
 planar 2D
 - shell (2D) elements: number of integration points are different than 3D
 - rigid surfaces: can't have deflection, only velocity, accel, etc.
 - road surfaces: have only a "segment ID" (serves as material ID) and a 
 velocity.
 - beam elements: have Frenet (TNB) frame and cross-section attributes 
 (shape and size)
 - spherical particle hydrodynamics (SPH) elements: have a radius of 
 influence, internal energy, etc.
 Because each mesh has its own cell attributes, the vtkLSDynaReader has a
 rather large API.  Instead of a single set of routines to query and set
 cell array names and status, one exists for each possible output mesh.
 Also, GetNumberOfCells() will return the sum of all the cells in all 7
 meshes.  If you want the number of cells in a specific mesh, there are
 separate routines for each mesh type.
