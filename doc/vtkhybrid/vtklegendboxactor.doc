\section Usage
 vtkLegendBoxActor is used to associate a symbol with a text string.
 The user specifies a vtkPolyData to use as the symbol, and a string
 associated with the symbol. The actor can then be placed in the scene
 in the same way that any other vtkActor2D can be used.

 To use this class, you must define the position of the legend box by using
 the superclasses' vtkActor2D::Position coordinate and
 Position2 coordinate. Then define the set of symbols and text strings that
 make up the menu box. The font attributes of the entries can be set through
 the vtkTextProperty associated to this actor. The class will
 scale the symbols and text to fit in the legend box defined by
 (Position,Position2). Optional features like turning on a border line and
 setting the spacing between the border and the symbols/text can also be
 set.

To create an instance of class vtkLegendBoxActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkLegendBoxActor
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkLegendBoxActor has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkLegendBoxActor class.

 this method is invoked previous entries are deleted. Also supply a text
