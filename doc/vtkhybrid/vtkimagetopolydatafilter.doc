\section Usage
 vtkImageToPolyDataFilter converts raster data (i.e., an image) into
 polygonal data (i.e., quads or n-sided polygons), with each polygon
 assigned a constant color. This is useful for writers that generate vector
 formats (i.e., CGM or PostScript). To use this filter, you specify how to
 quantize the color (or whether to use an image with a lookup table), and
 what style the output should be. The output is always polygons, but the
 choice is n x m quads (where n and m define the input image dimensions)
 "Pixelize" option; arbitrary polygons "Polygonalize" option; or variable
 number of quads of constant color generated along scan lines "RunLength"
 option.

 The algorithm quantizes color in order to create coherent regions that the
 polygons can represent with good compression. By default, the input image
 is quantized to 256 colors using a 3-3-2 bits for red-green-blue. However,
 you can also supply a single component image and a lookup table, with the
 single component assumed to be an index into the table.  (Note: a quantized
 image can be generated with the filter vtkImageQuantizeRGBToIndex.) The
 number of colors on output is equal to the number of colors in the input
 lookup table (or 256 if the built in linear ramp is used).

 The output of the filter is polygons with a single color per polygon cell.
 If the output style is set to "Polygonalize", the polygons may have an
 large number of points (bounded by something like 2*(n+m)); and the
 polygon may not be convex which may cause rendering problems on some
 systems (use vtkTriangleFilter). Otherwise, each polygon will have four
 vertices. The output also contains scalar data defining RGB color in
 unsigned char form.
