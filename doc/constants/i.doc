\page constants_i I-J Square Root of Negative One

<p>
Section: \ref sec_constants "Base Constants"
\section Usage
Returns a <tt>complex</tt> value that represents the square root of -1.  There are two
functions that return the same value:
\verbatim
   y = i
\endverbatim
and 
\verbatim
   y = j.
\endverbatim
This allows either <tt>i</tt> or <tt>j</tt> to be used as loop indices.  The returned value is a 32-bit complex value.
\section Example
The following examples demonstrate a few calculations with <tt>i</tt>.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_constants_i_000.m
0
i
i^2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_constants_i_000.m.out 

The same calculations with <tt>j</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_constants_i_001.m
0
j
j^2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_constants_i_001.m.out 

Here is an example of how <tt>i</tt> can be used as a loop index and then recovered as the square root of -1.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_constants_i_002.m
0
accum = 0; for i=1:100; accum = accum + i; end; accum
i
clear i
i
\endif


\verbinclude frag_constants_i_002.m.out
