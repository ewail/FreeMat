\page inspection_clear CLEAR Clear or Delete a Variable

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Clears a set of variables from the current context, or alternately, 
delete all variables defined in the current context.  There are
several formats for the function call.  The first is the explicit form
in which a list of variables are provided:
\verbatim
   clear a1 a2 ...
\endverbatim
The variables can be persistent or global, and they will be deleted.
The second form
\verbatim
   clear 'all'
\endverbatim
clears all variables and libraries from the current context.  Alternately, you can
use the form:
\verbatim
   clear 'libs'
\endverbatim
which will unload any libraries or DLLs that have been <tt>import</tt>ed. 
Optionally, you can specify that persistent variables should be cleared via:
\verbatim
   clear 'persistent'
\endverbatim
and similarly for global variables:
\verbatim
   clear 'global'
\endverbatim
You can use
\verbatim
   clear 'classes'
\endverbatim
to clear all definitions of user-defined classes.
With no arguments, <tt>clear</tt> defaults to clearing <tt>'all'</tt>.
\section Example
Here is a simple example of using <tt>clear</tt> to delete a variable.  First, we create a variable called <tt>a</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_clear_000.m
0
a = 53
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_clear_000.m.out 

Next, we clear <tt>a</tt> using the <tt>clear</tt> function, and verify that it is deleted.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_clear_001.m
1
clear a
a
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_clear_001.m.out
