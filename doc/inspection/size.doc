<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Returns the size of a variable.  There are two syntaxes for its
use.  The first syntax returns the size of the array as a vector
of integers, one integer for each dimension
\verbatim
  [d1,d2,...,dn] = size(x)
\endverbatim
The other format returns the size of <tt>x</tt> along a particular
dimension:
\verbatim
  d = size(x,n)
\endverbatim
where <tt>n</tt> is the dimension along which to return the size.
\section Example

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_size_000.m
0
a = randn(23,12,5);
size(a)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_size_000.m.out 

Here is an example of the second form of <tt>size</tt>.
