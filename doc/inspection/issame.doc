\page inspection_issame ISSAME Test If Two Arrays Are Identical

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Tests for two arrays to be identical.  The syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
   y = issame(a,b)
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are two arrays to compare.  This
comparison succeeds only if <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are of the
same data type, size, and contents.  Unlike numerical
equivalence tests, the <tt>issame</tt> function considers
<tt>NaN</tt> to be equal in both arguments.
