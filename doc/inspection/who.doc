\page inspection_who WHO Describe Currently Defined Variables

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the <tt>who</tt>
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:
\verbatim
  who a1 a2 ...
\endverbatim
In the second form
\verbatim
  who
\endverbatim
the <tt>who</tt> function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the <tt>who</tt> function:
\verbatim
  who 'a1' 'a2' ...
\endverbatim
and
\verbatim
  who('a1','a2',...)
\endverbatim
\section Example
Here is an example of the general use of <tt>who</tt>, which lists all of the variables defined.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_who_000.m
0
c = [1,2,3];
f = 'hello';
p = randn(1,256);
who
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_who_000.m.out 

In the second case, we examine only a specific variable:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_who_001.m
0
who c
who('c')
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_who_001.m.out
