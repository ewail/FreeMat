\page inspection_isnan ISNAN Test for Not-a-Numbers

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Returns true for entries of an array that are NaN's (i.e.,
Not-a-Numbers).  The usage is
\verbatim
   y = isnan(x)
\endverbatim
The result is a logical array of the same size as <tt>x</tt>,
which is true if <tt>x</tt> is not-a-number, and false otherwise.
Note that for complex data types that
the result is true if either the real or imaginary parts
are NaNs.
\section Example
Suppose we have an array of floats with one element that
is <tt>nan</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_isnan_000.m
0
a = [1.2 3.4 nan 5]
isnan(a)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_isnan_000.m.out
