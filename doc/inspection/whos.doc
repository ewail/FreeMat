\page inspection_whos WHOS Describe Currently Defined Variables With Memory Usage

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Reports information on either all variables in the current context
or on a specified set of variables.  For each variable, the <tt>who</tt>
function indicates the size and type of the variable as well as 
if it is a global or persistent.  There are two formats for the 
function call.  The first is the explicit form, in which a list
of variables are provided:
\verbatim
  whos a1 a2 ...
\endverbatim
In the second form
\verbatim
  whos
\endverbatim
the <tt>whos</tt> function lists all variables defined in the current 
context (as well as global and persistent variables). Note that
there are two alternate forms for calling the <tt>whos</tt> function:
\verbatim
  whos 'a1' 'a2' ...
\endverbatim
and
\verbatim
  whos('a1','a2',...)
\endverbatim
