\page inspection_isinf ISINF Test for infinities

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Returns true for entries of an array that are infs (i.e.,
infinities).  The usage is
\verbatim
   y = isinf(x)
\endverbatim
The result is a logical array of the same size as <tt>x</tt>,
which is true if <tt>x</tt> is not-a-number, and false otherwise.
Note that for <tt>complex</tt> or <tt>dcomplex</tt> data types that
the result is true if either the real or imaginary parts
are infinite.
\section Example
Suppose we have an array of floats with one element that
is <tt>inf</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_isinf_000.m
0
a = [1.2 3.4 inf 5]
isinf(a)
b = 3./[2 5 0 3 1]
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_isinf_000.m.out
