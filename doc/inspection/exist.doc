\page inspection_exist EXIST Test for Existence

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Tests for the existence of a variable, function, directory or
file.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = exist(item,kind)
\endverbatim
where <tt>item</tt> is a string containing the name of the item
to look for, and <tt>kind</tt> is a string indicating the type 
of the search.  The <tt>kind</tt> must be one of 
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>'builtin'</tt> checks for built-in functions
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>'dir'</tt> checks for directories
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>'file'</tt> checks for files
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>'var'</tt> checks for variables
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>'all'</tt> checks all possibilities (same as leaving out <tt>kind</tt>)
 </LI>
</UL>
You can also leave the <tt>kind</tt> specification out, in which case
the calling syntax is
\verbatim
  y = exist(item)
\endverbatim
The return code is one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>  0 - if <tt>item</tt> does not exist
 </LI>
<LI>  1 - if <tt>item</tt> is a variable in the workspace
 </LI>
<LI>  2 - if <tt>item</tt> is an M file on the search path, a full pathname
 to a file, or an ordinary file on your search path
 </LI>
<LI>  5 - if <tt>item</tt> is a built-in FreeMat function
 </LI>
<LI>  7 - if <tt>item</tt> is a directory
 </LI>
</UL>
Note: previous to version <tt>1.10</tt>, <tt>exist</tt> used a different notion
of existence for variables: a variable was said to exist if it 
was defined and non-empty.  This test is now performed by <tt>isset</tt>.
\section Example
Some examples of the <tt>exist</tt> function.  Note that generally <tt>exist</tt>
is used in functions to test for keywords.  For example,
\verbatim
  function y = testfunc(a, b, c)
  if (~exist('c'))
    % c was not defined, so establish a default
    c = 13;
  end
  y = a + b + c;
\endverbatim
An example of <tt>exist</tt> in action.
