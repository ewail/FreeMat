\page inspection_length LENGTH Length of an Array

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Returns the length of an array <tt>x</tt>.  The syntax for its use
is 
\verbatim
   y = length(x)
\endverbatim
and is defined as the maximum length of <tt>x</tt> along any of its
dimensions, i.e., <tt>max(size(x))</tt>.  If you want to determine the
number of elements in <tt>x</tt>, use the <tt>numel</tt> function instead.
\section Example
For a <tt>4 x 4 x 3</tt> matrix, the length is <tt>4</tt>, not <tt>48</tt>, as you 
might expect.
