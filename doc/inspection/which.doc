\page inspection_which WHICH Get Information on Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_inspection "Inspection Functions"
\section Usage
Returns information on a function (if defined).  The usage is
\verbatim
   which(fname)
\endverbatim
where <tt>fname</tt> is a <tt>string</tt> argument that contains the name of the 
function.  For functions and scripts defined
via <tt>.m</tt> files, the <tt>which</tt> command returns the location of the source
file:
\verbatim
   y = which(fname)
\endverbatim
will return the filename for the <tt>.m</tt> file corresponding to the given
function, and an empty string otherwise.
\section Example
First, we apply the <tt>which</tt> command to a built in function.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_which_000.m
0
which fft
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_which_000.m.out 

Next, we apply it to a function defined via a <tt>.m</tt> file.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_inspection_which_001.m
0
which fliplr
\endif


\verbinclude frag_inspection_which_001.m.out
