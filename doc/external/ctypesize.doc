\page external_ctypesize CTYPESIZE Compute Size of C Struct

<p>
Section: \ref sec_external "FreeMat External Interface"
\section Usage
The <tt>ctypesize</tt> function is used to compute the size of a C structure
that is defined using the <tt>ctypedefine</tt> function.  The usage of 
<tt>ctypesize</tt> is 
\verbatim
   size = ctypesize('typename')
\endverbatim
where <tt>typename</tt> is the name of the C structure you want to compute
the size of.  The returned count is measured in bytes.  Note that as
indicated in the help for <tt>ctypedefine</tt> that FreeMat does not 
automatically pad the entries of the structure to match the particulars
of your C compiler.  Instead, the assumption is that you have adequate
padding entries in your structure to align the FreeMat members with the
C ones.  See <tt>ctypedefine</tt> for more details.  You can also specify
an optional count parameter if you want to determine how large multiple
structures are
\verbatim
   size = ctypesize('typename',count)
\endverbatim
