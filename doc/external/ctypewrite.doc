<p>
Section: \ref sec_external "FreeMat External Interface"
\section Usage 
The <tt>ctypewrite</tt> function is a convenience function for
writing a C typedef to a file.  This is generally a very
bad idea, as writing of C typedefs to files is notoriously
unportable.  Consider yourself warned.  The syntax for this
function is 
\verbatim
  ctypewrite(fid,a,'typename')
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> is the FreeMat typedef to write, <tt>'typename'</tt> is
a string containing the name of the C typedef to use when
writing the typedef to the file (previously defined using
<tt>ctypedefine</tt>), and <tt>fid</tt> is the file handle returned
by <tt>fopen</tt>.
