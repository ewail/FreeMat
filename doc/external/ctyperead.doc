\section Usage
The <tt>ctyperead</tt> function is a convenience function for
reading a C structure from a file.  This is generally a
very bad idea, as direct writing of C structures to files
is notoriously unportable.  Consider yourself warned.  The
syntax for this function is
\verbatim
   a = ctyperead(fid,'typename')
\endverbatim
where <tt>'typename'</tt> is a string containing the name of the
C structure as defined using <tt>ctypedefine</tt>, and <tt>fid</tt>
is the file handle returned by the <tt>fopen</tt> command.  Note
that this form will read a single structure from the file.
If you want to read multiple structures into an array, 
use the following form
\verbatim
   a = ctyperead(fid,'typename',count)
\endverbatim
Note that the way this function works is by using <tt>ctypesize</tt>
to compute the size of the structure, reading that many bytes
from the file, and then calling <tt>ctypethaw</tt> on the resulting
buffer.  A consequence of this behavior is that the byte-endian
corrective behavior of FreeMat does not work.
