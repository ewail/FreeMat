<p>
Section: \ref sec_external "FreeMat External Interface"
\section Usage
The <tt>ctypenew</tt> function is a convenience function for
creating a FreeMat structure that corresponds to a C
structure.  The entire structure is initialized with zeros.
This has some negative implications, because if the 
structure definition uses <tt>cenums</tt>, they may come out
as <tt>'unknown'</tt> values if there are no enumerations corresponding
to zero.  The use of the function is
\verbatim
   a = ctypenew('typename')
\endverbatim
which creates a single structure of C structure type <tt>'typename'</tt>.
To create an array of structures, we can provide a second argument
\verbatim
   a = ctypenew('typename',count)
\endverbatim
where <tt>count</tt> is the number of elements in the structure array.
