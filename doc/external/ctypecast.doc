\page external_ctypecast CTYPECAST Cast FreeMat Structure to C Structure

<p>
Section: \ref sec_external "FreeMat External Interface"
\section Usage
The <tt>ctypecast</tt> function is a convenience function for ensuring that
a FreeMat structure fits the definition of a C struct (as defined
via <tt>ctypedefine</tt>.  It does so by encoding the structure
to a byte array using <tt>ctypefreeze</tt> and then recovering it using
the <tt>ctypethaw</tt> function.  The usage is simply
\verbatim
   s = ctypecast(s,typename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>s</tt> is the structure and <tt>typename</tt> is the name of the
C structure that describes the desired layout and types for elements
of <tt>s</tt>.  This function is equivalent to calling <tt>ctypefreeze</tt>
and <tt>ctypethaw</tt> in succession on a FreeMat structure.
