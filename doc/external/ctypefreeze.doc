<p>
Section: \ref sec_external "FreeMat External Interface"
\section Usage
The <tt>ctypefreeze</tt> function is used to convert a FreeMat structure into
a C struct as defined by a C structure typedef.  To use the <tt>cstructfreeze</tt>
function, you must first define the type of the C structure using the 
<tt>ctypedefine</tt> function.  The <tt>ctypefreeze</tt> function then serializes
a FreeMat structure to a set of bytes, and returns it as an array.  The
usage for <tt>ctypefreeze</tt> is
\verbatim
  byte_array = ctypefreeze(mystruct, 'typename')
\endverbatim
where <tt>mystruct</tt> is the array we want to 'freeze' to a memory array,
and <tt>typename</tt> is the name of the C type that we want the resulting
byte array to conform to.
