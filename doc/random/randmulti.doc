\page random_randmulti RANDMULTI Generate Multinomial-distributed Random Variables

<p>
Section: \ref sec_random "Random Number Generation"
\section Usage
This function generates samples from a multinomial distribution
given the probability of each outcome.  The general syntax for
its use is
\verbatim
   y = randmulti(N,pvec)
\endverbatim
where <tt>N</tt> is the number of experiments to perform, and <tt>pvec</tt>
is the vector of probabilities describing the distribution of
outcomes.
\section Function Internals
A multinomial distribution describes the number of times each
of <tt>m</tt> possible outcomes occurs out of <tt>N</tt> trials, where each
outcome has a probability <tt>p_i</tt>.  More generally, suppose that
the probability of a Bernoulli random variable <tt>X_i</tt> is <tt>p_i</tt>,
and that 
\f[
   \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i = 1.
\f]
Then the probability that <tt>X_i</tt> occurs <tt>x_i</tt> times is
\f[
   P_N(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{N!}{x_1!\cdots x_n!} p_1^{x_1}\cdots p_n^{x_n}.
\f]
\section Example
Suppose an experiment has three possible outcomes, say heads,
tails and edge, with probabilities <tt>0.4999</tt>, <tt>0.4999</tt> and
<tt>0.0002</tt>, respectively.  Then if we perform ten thousand coin
flips we get
