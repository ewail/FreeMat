\page random_randp RANDP Generate Poisson Random Variable

<p>
Section: \ref sec_random "Random Number Generation"
\section Usage
Generates a vector Poisson random variables with the given
parameters.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = randp(nu),
\endverbatim
where <tt>nu</tt> is an array containing the rate parameters
for the generated random variables.  
\section Function Internals
A Poisson random variable is generally defined by taking the
limit of a binomial distribution as the sample size becomes
large, with the expected number of successes being fixed (so
that the probability of success decreases as <tt>1/N</tt>).  
The Poisson distribution is given by
\f[
  P_{\nu}(n) = \frac{\nu^n e^{-nu}}{n!}.
\f]
\section Example
Here is an exmaple of using <tt>randp</tt> to generate some Poisson
random variables, and also using <tt>randbin</tt> to do the same
using <tt>N=1000</tt> trials to approximate the Poisson result.
