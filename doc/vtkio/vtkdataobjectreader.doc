\section Usage
 vtkDataObjectReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary field
 data files in vtk format. Fields are general matrix structures used
 represent complex data. (See text for format details).  The output of this
 reader is a single vtkDataObject.  The superclass of this class,
 vtkDataReader, provides many methods for controlling the reading of the
 data file, see vtkDataReader for more information.

To create an instance of class vtkDataObjectReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDataObjectReader
\endverbatim
\section Methods

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkDataObjectReader class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataObjectReader = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataObjectReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataObject = obj.GetOutput ()</tt> -  Get the output field of this reader.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataObject = obj.GetOutput (int idx)</tt> -  Get the output field of this reader.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOutput (vtkDataObject )</tt> -  Get the output field of this reader.
