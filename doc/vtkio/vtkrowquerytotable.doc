\section Usage
 vtkRowQueryToTable creates a vtkTable with the results of an arbitrary SQL
 query.  To use this filter, you first need an instance of a vtkSQLDatabase
 subclass.  You may use the database class to obtain a vtkRowQuery instance.
 Set that query on this filter to extract the query as a table.

 .SECTION Thanks
 Thanks to Andrew Wilson from Sandia National Laboratories for his work
 on the database classes.


To create an instance of class vtkRowQueryToTable, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkRowQueryToTable
\endverbatim
