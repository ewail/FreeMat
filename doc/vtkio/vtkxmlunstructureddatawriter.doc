In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkXMLUnstructuredDataWriter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkXMLUnstructuredDataWriter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkXMLUnstructuredDataWriter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNumberOfPieces (int )</tt> -  Get/Set the number of pieces used to stream the image through the
 pipeline while writing to the file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetNumberOfPieces ()</tt> -  Get/Set the number of pieces used to stream the image through the
 pipeline while writing to the file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetWritePiece (int )</tt> -  Get/Set the piece to write to the file.  If this is
 negative or equal to the NumberOfPieces, all pieces will be written.
 </LI>
