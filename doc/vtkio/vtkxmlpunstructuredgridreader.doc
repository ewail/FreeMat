\section Usage
 vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader reads the PVTK XML UnstructuredGrid
 file format.  This reads the parallel format's summary file and
 then uses vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader to read data from the
 individual UnstructuredGrid piece files.  Streaming is supported.
 The standard extension for this reader's file format is "pvtu".

To create an instance of class vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader
\endverbatim
