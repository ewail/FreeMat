\section Usage
 vtkMCubesWriter is a polydata writer that writes binary marching cubes
 files. (Marching cubes is an isosurfacing technique that generates many
 triangles.) The binary format is supported by W. Lorensen's marching cubes
 program (and the vtkSliceCubes object). Each triangle is represented by
 three records, with each record consisting of six single precision
 floating point numbers representing the a triangle vertex coordinate and
 vertex normal.

To create an instance of class vtkMCubesWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkMCubesWriter
\endverbatim
