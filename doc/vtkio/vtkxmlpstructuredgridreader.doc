 format.  This reads the parallel format's summary file and then
 uses vtkXMLStructuredGridReader to read data from the individual
 StructuredGrid piece files.  Streaming is supported.  The standard
 extension for this reader's file format is "pvts".

invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkXMLPStructuredGridReader
\endverbatim
