\section Usage
 vtkSimplePointsReader is a source object that reads a list of
 points from a file.  Each point is specified by three
 floating-point values in ASCII format.  There is one point per line
 of the file.  A vertex cell is created for each point in the
 output.  This reader is meant as an example of how to write a
 reader in VTK.

To create an instance of class vtkSimplePointsReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSimplePointsReader
\endverbatim
