\section Usage
 vtkGraphReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary 
 vtkGraph data files in vtk format. (see text for format details).
 The output of this reader is a single vtkGraph data object.
 The superclass of this class, vtkDataReader, provides many methods for
 controlling the reading of the data file, see vtkDataReader for more
 information.

To create an instance of class vtkGraphReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGraphReader
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkGraphReader has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkGraphReader class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGraphReader = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGraphReader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGraph = obj.GetOutput ()</tt> -  Get the output of this reader.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGraph = obj.GetOutput (int idx)</tt> -  Get the output of this reader.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetOutput (vtkGraph output)</tt> -  Get the output of this reader.
