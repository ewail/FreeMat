\section Usage
 vtkPLYReader is a source object that reads polygonal data in
 Stanford University PLY file format (see 
 http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep). It requires that
 the elements "vertex" and "face" are defined. The "vertex" element
 must have the properties "x", "y", and "z". The "face" element must
 have the property "vertex_indices" defined. Optionally, if the "face"
 element has the properties "intensity" and/or the triplet "red",
 "green", and "blue"; these are read and added as scalars to the
 output data.

To create an instance of class vtkPLYReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPLYReader
\endverbatim
