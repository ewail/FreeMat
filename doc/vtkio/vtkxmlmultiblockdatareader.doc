\section Usage
 vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader reads the VTK XML multi-block data file
 format. XML multi-block data files are meta-files that point to a list
 of serial VTK XML files. When reading in parallel, it will distribute
 sub-blocks among processor. If the number of sub-blocks is less than
 the number of processors, some processors will not have any sub-blocks
 for that block. If the number of sub-blocks is larger than the
 number of processors, each processor will possibly have more than
 1 sub-block.

To create an instance of class vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader
\endverbatim
