\section Usage
 vtkCGMWriter writes CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) output. CGM is a 2D
 graphics vector format typically used by large plotters. This writer can 
 handle vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips in any combination. 
 Colors are specified either 1) from cell scalars (assumed to be RGB or 
 RGBA color specification), 2) from a specified color; or 3) randomly 
 assigned colors.

 Note: During output of the polygonal data, triangle strips are converted
 to triangles, and polylines to lines. Also, due to limitations in the CGM 
 color model, only 256 colors are available to the color palette.

To create an instance of class vtkCGMWriter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCGMWriter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkCGMWriter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkCGMWriter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCGMWriter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCGMWriter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetViewport (vtkViewport )</tt> -  Specify a vtkViewport object to be used to transform the vtkPolyData
 points into 2D coordinates. By default (no vtkViewport specified), the 
 point coordinates are generated by ignoring the z values. If a viewport
 is defined, then the points are transformed into viewport coordinates.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkViewport = obj.GetViewport ()</tt> -  Specify a vtkViewport object to be used to transform the vtkPolyData
 points into 2D coordinates. By default (no vtkViewport specified), the 
 point coordinates are generated by ignoring the z values. If a viewport
 is defined, then the points are transformed into viewport coordinates.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSort (int )</tt> -  Turn on/off the sorting of the cells via depth. If enabled, polygonal
 cells will be sorted from back to front, i.e., a Painter's algorithm
 sort.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetSort ()</tt> -  Turn on/off the sorting of the cells via depth. If enabled, polygonal
 cells will be sorted from back to front, i.e., a Painter's algorithm
 sort.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetResolution (int )</tt> -  Specify the resolution of the CGM file. This number is used to integerize
 the maximum coordinate range of the plot file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetResolutionMinValue ()</tt> -  Specify the resolution of the CGM file. This number is used to integerize
 the maximum coordinate range of the plot file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetResolutionMaxValue ()</tt> -  Specify the resolution of the CGM file. This number is used to integerize
 the maximum coordinate range of the plot file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetResolution ()</tt> -  Specify the resolution of the CGM file. This number is used to integerize
 the maximum coordinate range of the plot file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetColorMode (int )</tt> -  Control how output polydata is colored. By default (ColorModeToDefault),
 if per cell colors are defined (unsigned chars of 1-4 components), then
 the cells are colored with these values. (If point colors are defined
 and cell colors are not, you can use vtkPointDataToCellData to convert
 the point colors to cell colors.) Otherwise, by default, the cells are
 set to the specified color. If ColorModeToSpecifiedColor is set, then
 the primitives will all be set to this color. If ColorModeToRandomColors
 is set, each cell will be randomly assigned a color.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetColorMode ()</tt> -  Control how output polydata is colored. By default (ColorModeToDefault),
 if per cell colors are defined (unsigned chars of 1-4 components), then
 the cells are colored with these values. (If point colors are defined
 and cell colors are not, you can use vtkPointDataToCellData to convert
 the point colors to cell colors.) Otherwise, by default, the cells are
 set to the specified color. If ColorModeToSpecifiedColor is set, then
 the primitives will all be set to this color. If ColorModeToRandomColors
 is set, each cell will be randomly assigned a color.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetColorModeToDefault ()</tt> -  Control how output polydata is colored. By default (ColorModeToDefault),
 if per cell colors are defined (unsigned chars of 1-4 components), then
 the cells are colored with these values. (If point colors are defined
 and cell colors are not, you can use vtkPointDataToCellData to convert
 the point colors to cell colors.) Otherwise, by default, the cells are
 set to the specified color. If ColorModeToSpecifiedColor is set, then
 the primitives will all be set to this color. If ColorModeToRandomColors
 is set, each cell will be randomly assigned a color.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetColorModeToSpecifiedColor ()</tt> -  Control how output polydata is colored. By default (ColorModeToDefault),
 if per cell colors are defined (unsigned chars of 1-4 components), then
 the cells are colored with these values. (If point colors are defined
 and cell colors are not, you can use vtkPointDataToCellData to convert
 the point colors to cell colors.) Otherwise, by default, the cells are
 set to the specified color. If ColorModeToSpecifiedColor is set, then
 the primitives will all be set to this color. If ColorModeToRandomColors
 is set, each cell will be randomly assigned a color.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetColorModeToRandomColors ()</tt> -  Control how output polydata is colored. By default (ColorModeToDefault),
 if per cell colors are defined (unsigned chars of 1-4 components), then
 the cells are colored with these values. (If point colors are defined
 and cell colors are not, you can use vtkPointDataToCellData to convert
 the point colors to cell colors.) Otherwise, by default, the cells are
 set to the specified color. If ColorModeToSpecifiedColor is set, then
 the primitives will all be set to this color. If ColorModeToRandomColors
 is set, each cell will be randomly assigned a color.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSpecifiedColor (float , float , float )</tt> -  Set/Get the specified color to color the polydata cells. This
 color is only used when the color mode is set to 
 ColorModeToSpecifiedColor, or ColorModeToDefault is set and no
 cell colors are specified. The specified color is specified as RGB 
 values ranging from (0,1). (Note: CGM will map this color to the
 closest color it supports.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSpecifiedColor (float  a[3])</tt> -  Set/Get the specified color to color the polydata cells. This
 color is only used when the color mode is set to 
 ColorModeToSpecifiedColor, or ColorModeToDefault is set and no
 cell colors are specified. The specified color is specified as RGB 
 values ranging from (0,1). (Note: CGM will map this color to the
 closest color it supports.)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>float = obj. GetSpecifiedColor ()</tt> -  Set/Get the specified color to color the polydata cells. This
 color is only used when the color mode is set to 
 ColorModeToSpecifiedColor, or ColorModeToDefault is set and no
 cell colors are specified. The specified color is specified as RGB 
 values ranging from (0,1). (Note: CGM will map this color to the
 closest color it supports.)
