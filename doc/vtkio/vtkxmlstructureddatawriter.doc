In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkXMLStructuredDataWriter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkXMLStructuredDataWriter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkXMLStructuredDataWriter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetNumberOfPieces (int )</tt> -  Get/Set the number of pieces used to stream the image through the
 pipeline while writing to the file.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetNumberOfPieces ()</tt> -  Get/Set the number of pieces used to stream the image through the
 pipeline while writing to the file.
 </LI>
