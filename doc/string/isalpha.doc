\page string_isalpha ISALPHA Test for Alpha Characters in a String

<p>
Section: \ref sec_string "String Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>isalpha</tt> functions returns a logical array that is 1 
for characters in the argument string that are letters, and 
is a logical 0 for characters in the argument that are not
letters.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   x = isalpha(s)
\endverbatim
where <tt>s</tt> is a <tt>string</tt>.  Note that this function is not
locale sensitive, and returns a logical 1 for letters in the
classic ASCII sense (a through z, and A through Z).
\section Example
A simple example of <tt>isalpha</tt>:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_string_isalpha_000.m
0
isalpha('numb3r5')
\endif


\verbinclude frag_string_isalpha_000.m.out
