\page string_strncmp STRNCMP String Compare Function To Length N 

<p>
Section: \ref sec_string "String Functions"
\section USAGE
Compares two strings for equality, but only looks at the
first N characters from each string.  The general syntax 
for its use is
\verbatim
  p = strncmp(x,y,n)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are two strings.  Returns <tt>true</tt> if <tt>x</tt>
and <tt>y</tt> are each at least <tt>n</tt> characters long, and if the
first <tt>n</tt> characters from each string are the same.  Otherwise,
it returns <tt>false</tt>.
In the second form, <tt>strncmp</tt> can be applied to a cell array of
strings.  The syntax for this form is
\verbatim
  p = strncmp(cellstra,cellstrb,n)
\endverbatim
where <tt>cellstra</tt> and <tt>cellstrb</tt> are cell arrays of a strings
to compare.  Also, you can also supply a character matrix as
an argument to <tt>strcmp</tt>, in which case it will be converted
via <tt>cellstr</tt> (so that trailing spaces are removed), before being
compared.
\section Example
The following piece of code compares two strings:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_string_strncmp_000.m
0
x1 = 'astring';
x2 = 'bstring';
x3 = 'astring';
strncmp(x1,x2,4)
strncmp(x1,x3,4)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_string_strncmp_000.m.out 

Here we use a cell array strings

\if FRAGMENT
frag_string_strncmp_001.m
0
x = {'ast','bst',43,'astr'}
p = strncmp(x,'ast',3)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_string_strncmp_001.m.out 

Here we compare two cell arrays of strings

\if FRAGMENT
frag_string_strncmp_002.m
0
strncmp({'this','is','a','pickle'},{'think','is','to','pickle'},3)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_string_strncmp_002.m.out 

Finally, the case where one of the arguments is a matrix
string

\if FRAGMENT
frag_string_strncmp_003.m
0
strncmp({'this','is','a','pickle'},['peter ';'piper ';'hated ';'pickle'],4);
\endif


\verbinclude frag_string_strncmp_003.m.out
