\section Usage
 vtkFrustumCoverageCuller will cull props based on the coverage in
 the view frustum. The coverage is computed by enclosing the prop in
 a bounding sphere, projecting that to the viewing coordinate system, then
 taking a slice through the view frustum at the center of the sphere. This
 results in a circle on the plane slice through the view frustum. This
 circle is enclosed in a squared, and the fraction of the plane slice that
 this square covers is the coverage. This is a number between 0 and 1.
 If the number is less than the MinumumCoverage, the allocated render time
 for that prop is set to zero. If it is greater than the MaximumCoverage,
 the allocated render time is set to 1.0. In between, a linear ramp is used
 to convert coverage into allocated render time.

To create an instance of class vtkFrustumCoverageCuller, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkFrustumCoverageCuller
\endverbatim

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkFrustumCoverageCuller class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkFrustumCoverageCuller = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetMinimumCoverage (double )</tt> -  Set/Get the minimum coverage - props with less coverage than this
 are given no time to render (they are culled)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetMinimumCoverage ()</tt> -  Set/Get the minimum coverage - props with less coverage than this
 are given no time to render (they are culled)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetMaximumCoverage (double )</tt> -  Set/Get the maximum coverage - props with more coverage than this are
 given an allocated render time of 1.0 (the maximum)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetMaximumCoverage ()</tt> -  Set/Get the maximum coverage - props with more coverage than this are
 given an allocated render time of 1.0 (the maximum)
