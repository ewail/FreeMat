\section Usage
 vtkRenderer provides an abstract specification for renderers. A renderer
 is an object that controls the rendering process for objects. Rendering
 is the process of converting geometry, a specification for lights, and
 a camera view into an image. vtkRenderer also performs coordinate
 transformation between world coordinates, view coordinates (the computer
 graphics rendering coordinate system), and display coordinates (the
 actual screen coordinates on the display device). Certain advanced
 rendering features such as two-sided lighting can also be controlled.

To create an instance of class vtkRenderer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkRenderer
\endverbatim

 actually used depth peeling.
 Initial value is false.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDelegate (vtkRendererDelegate d)</tt> -  Set/Get a custom Render call. Allows to hook a Render call from an
 external project.It will be used in place of vtkRenderer::Render() if it
 is not NULL and its Used ivar is set to true.
 Initial value is NULL.

<LI>  <tt>vtkHardwareSelector = obj.GetSelector ()</tt> -  Get the current hardware selector. If the Selector is set, it implies the
 current render pass is for selection. Mappers/Properties may choose to
 behave differently when rendering for hardware selection.
