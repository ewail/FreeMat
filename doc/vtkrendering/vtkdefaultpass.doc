\section Usage
 vtkDefaultPass implements the basic standard render passes of VTK.
 Subclasses can easily be implemented by reusing some parts of the basic
 implementation.

 It implements classic Render operations as well as versions with property
 key checking.

 This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
 Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value and
 background color/gradient/transparent color.
 

To create an instance of class vtkDefaultPass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDefaultPass
\endverbatim
