<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkrendering "Visualization Toolkit Rendering Classes"
\section Usage
 This is the abstract superclass for classes that handle single type
 of primitive i.e. verts, lines, polys or tstrips. 
 Concrete subclasses will pass a Render() call to the delegate painter,
 if any, only if it could not render.
 .SECTION Thanks
 Support for generic vertex attributes in VTK was contributed in
 collaboration with Stephane Ploix at EDF.

To create an instance of class vtkPrimitivePainter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPrimitivePainter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPrimitivePainter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkPrimitivePainter class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPrimitivePainter = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPrimitivePainter = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetSupportedPrimitive ()</tt> -  Get the type of primitive supported by this painter.
 This must be set by concrete subclasses.
 </LI>
</UL>
