\section Usage
 This class represents labels in a hierarchy used to denote rendering priority.
 A binary tree of labels is maintained that subdivides the bounds of the
 of the label anchors spatially. Which level of the tree a label occupies
 determines its priority; those at higher levels of the tree will be
 more likely to render than those at lower levels of the tree.

 Pass vtkLabelHierarchy objects to a vtkLabelPlacementMapper filter for dynamic,
 non-overlapping, per-frame placement of labels.

 Note that if we have a d-dimensional binary tree and we want a fixed
 number \f$n\f$ of labels in each node (all nodes, not just leaves),
 we can compute the depth of tree required assuming a uniform distribution
 of points. Given a total of \f$N\f$ points we know that
 \f$\frac{N}{|T|} = n\f$, where \f$|T|\f$ is the cardinality of the tree (i.e.,
 the number of nodes it contains).
 Because we have a uniform distribution, the tree will be uniformly subdivided
 and thus \f$|T| = 1 + 2^d + \left(2^d\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(2^d\right)^k\f$,
 where \f$d\f$ is the dimensionality of the input points (fixed at 3 for now).
 As \f$k\f$ becomes large, \f$|T|\approx 2 \left(2^d\right)^k\f$.
 Using this approximation, we can solve for \f$k\f$:
 \f[ k = \frac{\log{\frac{N}{2n}}}{\log{2^d}} \f]
 Given a set of \f$N\f$ input label anchors, we'll compute \f$k\f$ and then
 bin the anchors into tree nodes at level \f$k\f$ of the tree. After this,
 all the nodes will be in the leaves of the tree and those leaves will be at
 the \f$k\f$-th level; no anchors will be in levels \f$1, 2, \ldots, k-1\f$.
 To fix that, we'll choose to move some anchors upwards.
 The exact number to move upwards depends on \a TargetLabelCount. We'll
 move as many up as required to have \a TargetLabelCount at each node.

 You should avoid situations where \a MaximumDepth does not allow for
 \a TargetLabelCount or fewer entries at each node. The \a MaximumDepth
 is a hard limit while \a TargetLabelCount is a suggested optimum. You will
 end up with many more than \a TargetLabelCount entries per node and things
 will be sloooow.

 octree nodes whose labels should be placed.
