\section Usage
 vtkInteractorStyleJoystickCamera allows the user to move (rotate, pan,
 etc.) the camera, the point of view for the scene.  The position of the
 mouse relative to the center of the scene determines the speed at which
 the camera moves, and the speed of the mouse movement determines the
 acceleration of the camera, so the camera continues to move even if the
 mouse if not moving.
 For a 3-button mouse, the left button is for rotation, the right button
 for zooming, the middle button for panning, and ctrl + left button for
 spinning.  (With fewer mouse buttons, ctrl + shift + left button is
 for zooming, and shift + left button is for panning.)

To create an instance of class vtkInteractorStyleJoystickCamera, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkInteractorStyleJoystickCamera
\endverbatim
