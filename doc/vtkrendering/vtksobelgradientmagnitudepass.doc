\section Usage
 Detect the edges of the image renderered by its delegate. Edge-detection
 uses a Sobel high-pass filter (3x3 kernel).

 This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
 Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value and
 background color/gradient/transparent color.
 An opaque pass may have been performed right after the initialization.

 The delegate is used once.

 Its delegate is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a post-processing pass.
 
 This pass requires a OpenGL context that supports texture objects (TO),
 framebuffer objects (FBO) and GLSL. If not, it will emit an error message
 and will render its delegate and return.

 .SECTION Implementation
 To compute the gradient magnitude, the x and y components of the gradient
 (Gx and Gy) have to be computed first. Each computation of Gx and Gy uses
 a separable filter.
 The first pass takes the image from the delegate as the single input
 texture.
 The first pass has two outputs, one for the first part of Gx, Gx1, result of
 a convolution with (-1 0 1), one for the first part of Gy, Gy1, result of a
 convolution with (1 2 1).
 The second pass has two inputs, Gx1 and Gy1. Kernel (1 2 1)^T is applied
 to Gx1 and kernel (-1 0 1)^T is applied to Gx2. It gives the values for
 Gx and Gy. Thoses values are then used to compute the magnitude of the
 gradient which is stored in the render target.
 The gradient computation happens per component (R,G,B). A is arbitrarly set
 to 1 (full opacity).

To create an instance of class vtkSobelGradientMagnitudePass, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSobelGradientMagnitudePass
\endverbatim
