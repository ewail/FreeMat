\section Usage
 vtkLODProp3D is a class to support level of detail rendering for Prop3D.
 Any number of mapper/property/texture items can be added to this object.
 Render time will be measured, and will be used to select a LOD based on
 the AllocatedRenderTime of this Prop3D. Depending on the type of the
 mapper/property, a vtkActor or a vtkVolume will be created behind the
 scenes. 

To create an instance of class vtkLODProp3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkLODProp3D
\endverbatim
