\section Usage
 vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera allows the user to interactively
 manipulate (rotate, pan, etc.) the camera, the viewpoint of the scene.  In
 trackball interaction, the magnitude of the mouse motion is proportional
 to the camera motion associated with a particular mouse binding. For
 example, small left-button motions cause small changes in the rotation of
 the camera around its focal point. For a 3-button mouse, the left button
 is for rotation, the right button for zooming, the middle button for
 panning, and ctrl + left button for spinning.  (With fewer mouse buttons,
 ctrl + shift + left button is for zooming, and shift + left button is for
 panning.)

To create an instance of class vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera
\endverbatim
