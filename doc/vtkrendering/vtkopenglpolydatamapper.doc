\section Usage
 vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper is a subclass of vtkPolyDataMapper.
 vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper is a geometric PolyDataMapper for the OpenGL 
 rendering library.

To create an instance of class vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.RenderPiece (vtkRenderer ren, vtkActor a)</tt> -  Implement superclass render method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</tt> -  Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this mapper.
 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.Draw (vtkRenderer ren, vtkActor a)</tt> -  Draw method for OpenGL.
