\section Usage
 vtkTDxInteractorStyle is an abstract class defining an event-driven
 interface to support 3DConnexion device events send by
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor.
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor forwards events in a platform independent form to
 vtkInteractorStyle which can then delegate some processing to
 vtkTDxInteractorStyle.

To create an instance of class vtkTDxInteractorStyle, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTDxInteractorStyle
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTDxInteractorStyle has several methods that can be used.

In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTDxInteractorStyle class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTDxInteractorStyle = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTDxInteractorStyle = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTDxInteractorStyleSettings = obj.GetSettings ()</tt> -  3Dconnexion device settings. (sensitivity, individual axis filters).
 Initial object is not null.
