\section Usage
 vtkQuadricLODActor implements a specific strategy for level-of-detail
 using the vtkQuadricClustering decimation algorithm. It supports only two
 levels of detail: full resolution and a decimated version. The decimated
 LOD is generated using a tuned strategy to produce output consistent with
 the requested interactive frame rate (i.e., the
 vtkRenderWindowInteractor's DesiredUpdateRate). It also makes use of
 display lists for performance, and adjusts the vtkQuadricClustering
 algorithm to take into account the dimensionality of the data (e.g., 2D,
 x-y surfaces may be binned into n x n x 1 to reduce extra polygons in the
 z-direction). Finally, the filter may optionally be set in "Static" mode
 (this works with the vtkMapper::SetStatic() method). `Enabling Static results
 in a one time execution of the Mapper's pipeline. After that, the pipeline
 no longer updated (unless manually forced to do so). 


To create an instance of class vtkQuadricLODActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkQuadricLODActor

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDeferLODConstruction (int )</tt> -  Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render)
 or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default,
 LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetDeferLODConstruction ()</tt> -  Specify whether to build the LOD immediately (i.e., on the first render)
 or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default,
 LOD construction is not deferred (DeferLODConstruction is false).
 </LI>

 or to wait until the LOD is requested in a subsequent render. By default,

 If static, this means that the data pipeline executes once and then not 
 again until the user manually modifies this class. By default, Static is
 off because trying to debug this is tricky, and you should only use it
 when you know what you are doing.
 </LI>
