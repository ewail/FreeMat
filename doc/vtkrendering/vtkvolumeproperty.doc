\section Usage
 vtkVolumeProperty is used to represent common properties associated 
 with volume rendering. This includes properties for determining the type
 of interpolation to use when sampling a volume, the color of a volume, 
 the scalar opacity of a volume, the gradient opacity of a volume, and the 
 shading parameters of a volume.

 When the scalar opacity or the gradient opacity of a volume is not set,
 then the function is defined to be a constant value of 1.0. When a
 scalar and gradient opacity are both set simultaneously, then the opacity
 is defined to be the product of the scalar opacity and gradient opacity 
 transfer functions.
 
 Most properties can be set per "component" for volume mappers that
 support multiple independent components. If you are using 2 component
 data as LV or 4 component data as RGBV (as specified in the mapper) 
 only the first scalar opacity and gradient opacity transfer functions
 will be used (and all color functions will be ignored). Omitting the
 index parameter on the Set/Get methods will access index = 0.

To create an instance of class vtkVolumeProperty, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkVolumeProperty
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkVolumeProperty has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkVolumeProperty class.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetIndependentComponents (int )</tt> -  Does the data have independent components, or do some define color 
 only? If IndependentComponents is On (the default) then each component 
 will be independently passed through a lookup table to determine RGBA, 
 shaded. Some volume Mappers can handle 1 to 4 component 
 unsigned char or unsigned short data (see each mapper header file to
 determine functionality). If IndependentComponents is Off, then you 
 must have either 2 or 4 component data. For 2 component data, the 
 first is passed through the first color transfer function and the 
 second component is passed through the first opacity transfer function. 
 Normals will be generated off of the second component. For 4 component 
 data, the first three will directly represent RGB (no lookup table). 
 The fourth component will be passed through the first scalar opacity 
 transfer function for opacity. Normals will be generated from the fourth 
 component.
