In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkImageProcessingPass class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkImageProcessingPass = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkImageProcessingPass = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow w)</tt> -  Release graphics resources and ask components to release their own
 resources.
 \pre w_exists: w!=0
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkRenderPass = obj.GetDelegatePass ()</tt> -  Delegate for rendering the image to be processed.
 If it is NULL, nothing will be rendered and a warning will be emitted.
 It is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a post-processing pass.
 Initial value is a NULL pointer.
