\section Usage
 vtkGLSLShader is a concrete class that creates and compiles hardware
 shaders written in the OpenGL Shadering Language (GLSL, OpenGL2.0).
 While step linking a vertex and a fragment shader is performed by
 vtkGLSLShaderProgram, all shader parameters are initialized in this
 class.

 .Section vtkOpenGLExtensionManager
 All OpenGL calls are made through vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.

 .Section Supported Basic Shader Types:

 Scalar Types
 uniform float
 uniform int
 uniform int -- boolean scalar not yet tested

 Vector Types:
 uniform vec{2|3|4}
 uniform ivec{2|3|4}
 uniform bvec{2|3|4} -- boolean vector not yet tested

 Matrix Types:
 uniform mat{2|3|4}

 Texture Samplers:
 sample1D -- Not yet implemented in this cless.
 sample2D -- Not yet implemented in this class.
 sample3D -- Not yet implemented in this class.
 sampler1DShadow -- Not yet implemented in this class.
 sampler1DShadow -- Not yet implemented in this class.
 
 User-Defined structures:
 uniform struct
  NOTE: these must be defined and declared  outside of the 'main' shader
  function.

 Sandia National Labs.

To create an instance of class vtkGLSLShader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGLSLShader
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkGLSLShader has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkGLSLShader class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGLSLShader = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkGLSLShader = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.Compile ()</tt> -  Called to compile the shader code.
 The subclasses must only compile the code in this method.
 Returns if the compile was successful.
 Subclasses should compile the code only if it was not
 already compiled.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetHandle ()</tt> -  The Shader needs the id of the ShaderProgram
 to obtain uniform variable locations. This is set
 by vtkGLSLShaderProgram.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProgram (int )</tt> -  The Shader needs the id of the ShaderProgram
 to obtain uniform variable locations. This is set
 by vtkGLSLShaderProgram.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetProgram ()</tt> -  The Shader needs the id of the ShaderProgram
 to obtain uniform variable locations. This is set
 by vtkGLSLShaderProgram.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</tt> -  Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>
</UL>
