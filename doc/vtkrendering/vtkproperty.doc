\section Usage
 vtkProperty is an object that represents lighting and other surface
 properties of a geometric object. The primary properties that can be 
 set are colors (overall, ambient, diffuse, specular, and edge color);
 specular power; opacity of the object; the representation of the
 object (points, wireframe, or surface); and the shading method to be 
 used (flat, Gouraud, and Phong). Also, some special graphics features
 like backface properties can be set and manipulated with this object.

To create an instance of class vtkProperty, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkProperty
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkProperty has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkProperty class.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Render (vtkActor , vtkRenderer )</tt> -  This method causes the property to set up whatever is required for
