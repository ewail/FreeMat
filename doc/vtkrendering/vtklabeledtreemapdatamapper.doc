\section Usage
 vtkLabeledTreeMapDataMapper is a mapper that renders text on a tree map.
 A tree map is a vtkTree with an associated 4-tuple array
 used for storing the boundary rectangle for each vertex in the tree.
 The user must specify the array name used for storing the rectangles.

 The mapper iterates through the tree and attempts and renders a label
 inside the vertex's rectangle as long as the following conditions hold:
 1. The vertex level is within the range of levels specified for labeling.
 2. The label can fully fit inside its box.
 3. The label does not overlap an ancestor's label.


To create an instance of class vtkLabeledTreeMapDataMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkLabeledTreeMapDataMapper
\endverbatim
