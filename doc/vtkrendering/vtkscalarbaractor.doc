\section Usage
 vtkScalarBarActor creates a scalar bar with annotation text. A scalar
 bar is a legend that indicates to the viewer the correspondence between
 color value and data value. The legend consists of a rectangular bar 
 made of rectangular pieces each colored a constant value. Since 
 vtkScalarBarActor is a subclass of vtkActor2D, it is drawn in the image 
 plane (i.e., in the renderer's viewport) on top of the 3D graphics window.

 To use vtkScalarBarActor you must associate a vtkScalarsToColors (or
 subclass) with it. The lookup table defines the colors and the
 range of scalar values used to map scalar data.  Typically, the
 number of colors shown in the scalar bar is not equal to the number
 of colors in the lookup table, in which case sampling of
 the lookup table is performed. 

 Other optional capabilities include specifying the fraction of the
 viewport size (both x and y directions) which will control the size
 of the scalar bar and the number of annotation labels. The actual position
 of the scalar bar on the screen is controlled by using the
 vtkActor2D::SetPosition() method (by default the scalar bar is
 centered in the viewport).  Other features include the ability to
 orient the scalar bar horizontally of vertically and controlling
 the format (printf style) with which to print the labels on the
 scalar bar. Also, the vtkScalarBarActor's property is applied to
 the scalar bar and annotation (including layer, and
 compositing operator).

 Set the text property/attributes of the title and the labels through the 
 vtkTextProperty objects associated to this actor.
