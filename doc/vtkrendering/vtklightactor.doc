Section: \ref sec_vtkrendering "Visualization Toolkit Rendering Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkLightActor is a composite actor used to represent a spotlight. The cone
 angle is equal to the spotlight angle, the cone apex is at the position of
 the light, the direction of the light goes from the cone apex to the center
 of the base of the cone. The square frustum position is the light position,
 the frustum focal point is in the direction of the light direction. The
 frustum vertical view angle (aperture) (this is also the horizontal view
 angle as the frustum is square) is equal to twice the cone angle. The
 clipping range of the frustum is arbitrary set by the user
 (initially at 0.5,11.0).

To create an instance of class vtkLightActor, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkLightActor
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkLightActor has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkLightActor class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkLightActor = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkLightActor = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLight (vtkLight light)</tt> -  The spotlight to represent. Initial value is NULL.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkLight = obj.GetLight ()</tt> -  The spotlight to represent. Initial value is NULL.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetClippingRange (double dNear, double dFar)</tt> -  Set/Get the location of the near and far clipping planes along the
 direction of projection.  Both of these values must be positive.
 Initial values are  (0.5,11.0)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetClippingRange (double a[2])</tt> -  Set/Get the location of the near and far clipping planes along the
 direction of projection.  Both of these values must be positive.
 Initial values are  (0.5,11.0)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetClippingRange ()</tt> -  Set/Get the location of the near and far clipping planes along the
 direction of projection.  Both of these values must be positive.
 Initial values are  (0.5,11.0)
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.RenderOpaqueGeometry (vtkViewport viewport)</tt> -  Support the standard render methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.HasTranslucentPolygonalGeometry ()</tt> -  Does this prop have some translucent polygonal geometry? No.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</tt> -  Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>long = obj.GetMTime ()</tt> -  Get the actors mtime plus consider its properties and texture if set.
 </LI>
</UL>
