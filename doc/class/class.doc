\page class_class CLASS Class Support Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_class "Object Oriented Programming"
\section Usage
There are several uses for the <tt>class</tt> function.  The first
version takes a single argument, and returns the class of
that variable.  The syntax for this form is
\verbatim
  classname = class(variable)
\endverbatim
and it returns a string containing the name of the class for
<tt>variable</tt>.  The second form of the class function is used
to construct an object of a specific type based on a structure
which contains data elements for the class.  The syntax for
this version is
\verbatim
  classvar = class(template, classname, parent1, parent2,...)
\endverbatim
This should be called inside the constructor for the class.
The resulting class will be of the type <tt>classname</tt>, and will
be derived from <tt>parent1</tt>, <tt>parent2</tt>, etc.  The <tt>template</tt>
argument should be a structure array that contains the members
of the class.  See the <tt>constructors</tt> help for some details
on how to use the <tt>class</tt> function.  Note that if the
<tt>template</tt> argument is an empty structure matrix, then the
resulting variable has no fields beyond those inherited from
the parent classes.
