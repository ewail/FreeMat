\page class_horzcat HORZCAT Overloaded Horizontal Concatenation

<p>
Section: \ref sec_class "Object Oriented Programming"
\section Usage
This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called
when you invoke
\verbatim
   c = horzcat(a,b,c)
\endverbatim
when <tt>a</tt> is a class, it is also called for 
\verbatim
   c = [a,b,c]
\endverbatim
when one of these variables is a class.  The exact meaning of
horizontal concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
