\page class_vertcat VERTCAT Overloaded Vertical Concatenation

<p>
Section: \ref sec_class "Object Oriented Programming"
\section Usage
This is a method for a class that is invoked to concatenate two or more
variables of the same class type together.  Besides being called when
you invoke
\verbatim
   c = vertcat(a,b,c)
\endverbatim
when <tt>a</tt> is a class, it is also called for
\verbatim
   c = [a;b;c]
\endverbatim
when one of the variables is a class.  The exact meaning of 
vertical concatenation depends on the class you have designed.
