\page class_subsasgn SUBSASGN Overloaded Class Assignment

<p>
Section: \ref sec_class "Object Oriented Programming"
\section Usage
This method is called for expressions of the form
\verbatim
  a(b) = c, a{b} = c, a.b = c
\endverbatim
and overloading the <tt>subsasgn</tt> method can allow you
to define the meaning of these expressions for
objects of class <tt>a</tt>.  These expressions are mapped
to a call of the form
\verbatim
  a = subsasgn(a,s,b)
\endverbatim
where <tt>s</tt> is a structure array with two fields.  The
first field is
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>type</tt>  is a string containing either <tt>'()'</tt> or
 <tt>'{}'</tt> or <tt>'.'</tt> depending on the form of the call.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>subs</tt> is a cell array or string containing the
 the subscript information.
 </LI>
</UL>
When multiple indexing experssions are combined together
such as <tt>a(5).foo{:} = b</tt>, the <tt>s</tt> array contains
the following entries
\verbatim
  s(1).type = '()'  s(1).subs = {5}
  s(2).type = '.'   s(2).subs = 'foo'
  s(3).type = '{}'  s(3).subs = ':'
\endverbatim
