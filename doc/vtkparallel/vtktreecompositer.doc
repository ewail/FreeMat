Section: \ref sec_vtkparallel "Visualization Toolkit Parallel Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkTreeCompositer operates in multiple processes.  Each compositer has 
 a render window.  They use a vtkMultiProcessController to communicate 
 the color and depth buffer to process 0's render window.
 It will not handle transparency well.


To create an instance of class vtkTreeCompositer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTreeCompositer
\endverbatim
