\section Usage
 This filter integrates streamlines on a distributed dataset. It is
 essentially a serial algorithm: only one process is active at one
 time and it is not more efficient than a single process integration.
 It is useful when the data is too large to be on one process and
 has to be kept distributed.

To create an instance of class vtkDistributedStreamTracer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDistributedStreamTracer
\endverbatim
