\section Usage

 vtkPNrrdReader is a subclass of vtkMPIImageReader that will read Nrrd format
 header information of the image before reading the data.  This means that the
 reader will automatically set information like file dimensions.

 .SECTION Bugs

 There are several limitations on what type of nrrd files we can read.  This
 reader only supports nrrd files in raw format.  Other encodings like ascii
 and hex will result in errors.  When reading in detached headers, this only
 supports reading one file that is detached.


To create an instance of class vtkPNrrdReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPNrrdReader
\endverbatim
