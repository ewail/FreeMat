\section Usage
 vtkImageRenderManager is a subclass of vtkParallelRenderManager that
 uses RGBA compositing (blending) to do parallel rendering.
 This is the exact opposite of vtkCompositeRenderManager.
 It actually does nothing special. It relies on the rendering pipeline to be
 initialized with a vtkCompositeRGBAPass.
 Compositing makes sense only for renderers in layer 0.

To create an instance of class vtkImageRenderManager, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageRenderManager
\endverbatim
