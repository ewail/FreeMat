\section Usage
 vtkPOpenFOAMReader creates a multiblock dataset. It reads
 parallel-decomposed mesh information and time dependent data.  The
 polyMesh folders contain mesh information. The time folders contain
 transient data for the cells. Each folder can contain any number of
 data files.

To create an instance of class vtkPOpenFOAMReader, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPOpenFOAMReader
\endverbatim
\section Methods
