Section: \ref sec_vtkparallel "Visualization Toolkit Parallel Classes"
\section Usage
 This is an abstact class which contains functionality for sending
 and receiving inter-process messages. It contains methods for marshaling
 an object into a string (currently used by the MPI communicator but
 not the shared memory communicator).

To create an instance of class vtkCommunicator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCommunicator
\endverbatim
\section Methods

 Note that this is not the number of bytes received, but the number of items
 of the data-type received by the most recent Receive() eg. if
 Receive(int*,..) was used, then this returns the number of ints received;
 if Receive(double*,..) was used, then this returns the number of doubles
 received etc. The return value is valid only after a successful Receive().
