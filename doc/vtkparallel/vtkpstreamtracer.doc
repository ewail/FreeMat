<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkparallel "Visualization Toolkit Parallel Classes"
\section Usage
 This class implements some necessary functionality used by distributed
 and parallel streamline generators. Note that all processes must have
 access to the WHOLE seed source, i.e. the source must be identical
 on all processes.

To create an instance of class vtkPStreamTracer, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPStreamTracer
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPStreamTracer has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkPStreamTracer class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPStreamTracer = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkPStreamTracer = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetController (vtkMultiProcessController controller)</tt> -  Set/Get the controller use in compositing (set to
 the global controller by default)
 If not using the default, this must be called before any
 other methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkMultiProcessController = obj.GetController ()</tt> -  Set/Get the controller use in compositing (set to
 the global controller by default)
 If not using the default, this must be called before any
 other methods.
