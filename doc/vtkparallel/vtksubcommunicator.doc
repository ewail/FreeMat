\section Usage

 This class provides an implementation for communicating on process groups.
 In general, you should never use this class directly.  Instead, use the
 vtkMultiProcessController::CreateSubController method.

 .SECTION BUGS

 Because all communication is delegated to the original communicator,
 any error will report process ids with respect to the original
 communicator, not this communicator that was actually used.


To create an instance of class vtkSubCommunicator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSubCommunicator
\endverbatim
