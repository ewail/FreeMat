<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Raises one numerical array to another array (elementwise).  There are three operators all with the same general syntax:
\verbatim
  y = a .^ b
\endverbatim
The result <tt>y</tt> depends on which of the following three situations applies to the arguments <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>:
<OL>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> is a scalar, <tt>b</tt> is an arbitrary <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is <tt>a</tt> raised to the power of each element of <tt>b</tt>, and the output is the same size as <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, and <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, then the output is the same size as <tt>a</tt>, and is defined by each element of <tt>a</tt> raised to the power <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are both <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical arrays of <strong>the same size</strong>.  In this case, each element of the output is the corresponding element of <tt>a</tt> raised to the power defined by the corresponding element of <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
</OL>

The rules for manipulating types has changed in FreeMat 4.0.  See <tt>typerules</tt>
for more details.

\section Function Internals
There are three formulae for this operator.  For the first form
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a^{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)},
\f]
and the second form
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)^b,
\f]
and in the third form
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)^{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}.
\f]
\section Examples
We demonstrate the three forms of the dot-power operator using some simple examples.  First, the case of a scalar raised to a series of values.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotpower_000.m
0
a = 2
b = 1:4
c = a.^b
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotpower_000.m.out 

The second case shows a vector raised to a scalar.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotpower_001.m
0
c = b.^a
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotpower_001.m.out 

The third case shows the most general use of the dot-power operator.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotpower_002.m
0
A = [1,2;3,2]
B = [2,1.5;0.5,0.6]
C = A.^B
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotpower_002.m.out
