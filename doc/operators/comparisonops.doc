<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
There are a total of six comparison operators available in FreeMat, all of which are binary operators with the following syntax
\verbatim
  y = a < b
  y = a <= b
  y = a > b
  y = a >= b
  y = a ~= b
  y = a == b
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are numerical arrays or scalars, and <tt>y</tt> is a <tt>logical</tt> array of the appropriate size.  Each of the operators has three modes of operation, summarized in the following list:
<OL>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> is a scalar, <tt>b</tt> is an n-dimensional array - the output is then the same size as <tt>b</tt>, and contains the result of comparing each element in <tt>b</tt> to the scalar <tt>a</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> is an n-dimensional array, <tt>b</tt> is a scalar - the output is the same size as <tt>a</tt>, and contains the result of comparing each element in <tt>a</tt> to the scalar <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are both n-dimensional arrays of the same size - the output is then the same size as both <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>, and contains the result of an element-wise comparison between <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
</OL>
The operators behave the same way as in <tt>C</tt>, with unequal types being promoted using the standard type promotion rules prior to comparisons.  The only difference is that in FreeMat, the not-equals operator is <tt>~=</tt> instead of <tt>!=</tt>.
\section Examples
Some simple examples of comparison operations.  First a comparison with a scalar:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_comparisonops_000.m
0
a = randn(1,5)
a>0
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_comparisonops_000.m.out 

Next, we construct two vectors, and test for equality:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_comparisonops_001.m
0
a = [1,2,5,7,3]
b = [2,2,5,9,4]
c = a == b
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_comparisonops_001.m.out
