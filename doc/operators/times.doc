\page operators_times TIMES Matrix Multiply Operator

<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Multiplies two numerical arrays.  This operator is really a combination
of three operators, all of which have the same general syntax:
\verbatim
  y = a * b
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are arrays of numerical type.  The result <tt>y</tt> depends
on which of the following three situations applies to the arguments
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>:
<OL>
  <LI> <tt>a</tt> is a scalar, <tt>b</tt> is an arbitrary <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is the element-wise product of <tt>b</tt> with the scalar <tt>a</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, <tt>a</tt> is an arbitrary <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is the element-wise product of <tt>a</tt> with the scalar <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>a,b</tt> are conformant matrices, i.e., <tt>a</tt> is of size <tt>M x K</tt>, and <tt>b</tt> is of size <tt>K x N</tt>, in which case the output is of size <tt>M x N</tt> and is the matrix product of <tt>a</tt>, and <tt>b</tt>.
</LI>
</OL>
Matrix multiplication is only defined for matrices of type <tt>double</tt> 
and <tt>single</tt>.
\section Function Internals
There are three formulae for the times operator.  For the first form
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a \times b(m_1,\ldots,m_d),
\f]
and the second form
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d) \times b.
\f]
In the third form, the output is the matrix product of the arguments
\f[
y(m,n) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} a(m,k) b(k,n)
\f]
\section Examples
Here are some examples of using the matrix multiplication operator.  First,
the scalar examples (types 1 and 2 from the list above):

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_times_000.m
0
a = [1,3,4;0,2,1]
b = a * 2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_times_000.m.out 

The matrix form, where the first argument is <tt>2 x 3</tt>, and the
second argument is <tt>3 x 1</tt>, so that the product is size 
<tt>2 x 1</tt>.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_times_001.m
0
a = [1,2,0;4,2,3]
b = [5;3;1]
c = a*b
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_times_001.m.out 

Note that the output is double precision.
