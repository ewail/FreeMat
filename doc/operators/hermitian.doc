\page operators_hermitian HERMITIAN Matrix Hermitian (Conjugate Transpose) Operator

<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Computes the Hermitian of the argument (a 2D matrix).  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = a';
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> is a <tt>M x N</tt> numerical matrix.  The output <tt>y</tt> is a numerical matrix
of the same type of size <tt>N x M</tt>.  This operator is the conjugating transpose,
which is different from the transpose operator <tt>.'</tt> (which does not 
conjugate complex values).
\section Function Internals
The Hermitian operator is defined simply as
\f[
  y_{i,j} = \overline{a_{j,i}}
\f]
where <tt>y_ij</tt> is the element in the <tt>i</tt>th row and <tt>j</tt>th column of the output matrix <tt>y</tt>.
\section Examples
A simple transpose example:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_hermitian_000.m
0
A = [1,2,0;4,1,-1]
A'
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_hermitian_000.m.out 

Here, we use a complex matrix to demonstrate how the Hermitian operator conjugates the entries.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_hermitian_001.m
0
A = [1+i,2-i]
A.'
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_hermitian_001.m.out
