<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Divides two numerical arrays (elementwise) - gets its name from the 
fact that the divisor is on the left.  There are two forms
for its use, both with the same general syntax:
\verbatim
  y = a .\ b
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are <tt>n</tt>-dimensional arrays of numerical type.  In the
first case, the two arguments are the same size, in which case, the 
output <tt>y</tt> is the same size as the inputs, and is the element-wise
division of <tt>b</tt> by <tt>a</tt>.  In the second case, either <tt>a</tt> or <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, 
in which case <tt>y</tt> is the same size as the larger argument,
and is the division of the scalar with each element of the other argument.

The rules for manipulating types has changed in FreeMat 4.0.  See <tt>typerules</tt>
for more details.

\section Function Internals
There are three formulae for the dot-left-divide operator, depending on the
sizes of the three arguments.  In the most general case, in which 
the two arguments are the same size, the output is computed via:
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}
\f]
If <tt>a</tt> is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{a}
\f]
On the other hand, if <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{b}{a(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}.
\f]
\section Examples
Here are some examples of using the dot-left-divide operator.  First, a 
straight-forward usage of the <tt>.\\</tt> operator.  The first example
is straightforward:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotleftdivide_000.m
0
3 .\ 8
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotleftdivide_000.m.out 


We can also divide complex arguments:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotleftdivide_001.m
0
a = 3 + 4*i
b = 5 + 8*i
c = b .\ a
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotleftdivide_001.m.out 

We can also demonstrate the three forms of the dot-left-divide operator.  First
the element-wise version:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotleftdivide_002.m
0
a = [1,2;3,4]
b = [2,3;6,7]
c = a .\ b
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotleftdivide_002.m.out 

Then the scalar versions

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_dotleftdivide_003.m
0
c = a .\ 3
c = 3 .\ a
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_dotleftdivide_003.m.out
