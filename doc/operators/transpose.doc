\page operators_transpose TRANSPOSE Matrix Transpose Operator

<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Performs a transpose of the argument (a 2D matrix).  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = a.';
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> is a <tt>M x N</tt> numerical matrix.  The output <tt>y</tt> is a numerical matrix
of the same type of size <tt>N x M</tt>.  This operator is the non-conjugating transpose,
which is different from the Hermitian operator <tt>'</tt> (which conjugates complex values).
\section Function Internals
The transpose operator is defined simply as
\f[
  y_{i,j} = a_{j,i}
\f]
where <tt>y_ij</tt> is the element in the <tt>i</tt>th row and <tt>j</tt>th column of the output matrix <tt>y</tt>.
\section Examples
A simple transpose example:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_transpose_000.m
0
A = [1,2,0;4,1,-1]
A.'
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_transpose_000.m.out 

Here, we use a complex matrix to demonstrate how the transpose does <strong>not</strong> conjugate the entries.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_transpose_001.m
0
A = [1+i,2-i]
A.'
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_transpose_001.m.out
