\page operators_plus PLUS Addition Operator

<p>
Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
Adds two numerical arrays (elementwise) together.  There are two forms
for its use, both with the same general syntax:
\verbatim
  y = a + b
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are <tt>n</tt>-dimensional arrays of numerical type.  In the
first case, the two arguments are the same size, in which case, the 
output <tt>y</tt> is the same size as the inputs, and is the element-wise the sum 
of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.  In the second case, either <tt>a</tt> or <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, 
in which case <tt>y</tt> is the same size as the larger argument,
and is the sum of the scalar added to each element of the other argument.

The rules for manipulating types has changed in FreeMat 4.0.  See <tt>typerules</tt>
for more details.

\section Function Internals
There are three formulae for the addition operator, depending on the
sizes of the three arguments.  In the most general case, in which 
the two arguments are the same size, the output is computed via:
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d) + b(m_1,\ldots,m_d)
\f]
If <tt>a</tt> is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a + b(m_1,\ldots,m_d).
\f]
On the other hand, if <tt>b</tt> is a scalar, then the output is computed via
\f[
y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = a(m_1,\ldots,m_d) + b.
\f]
\section Examples
Here are some examples of using the addition operator.  First, a 
straight-forward usage of the plus operator.  The first example
is straightforward:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_plus_000.m
0
3 + 8
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_plus_000.m.out 

Next, we add a scalar to a vector of values:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_plus_001.m
0
3.1 + [2,4,5,6,7]
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_plus_001.m.out 

With complex values

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_plus_002.m
0
a = 3 + 4*i
b = a + 2
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_plus_002.m.out 

Finally, the element-wise version:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_plus_003.m
0
a = [1,2;3,4]
b = [2,3;6,7]
c = a + b
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_plus_003.m.out
