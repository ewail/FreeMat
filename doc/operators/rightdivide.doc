Section: \ref sec_operators "Mathematical Operators"
\section Usage
The divide operator <tt>/</tt> is really a combination of three
operators, all of which have the same general syntax:
\verbatim
  Y = A / B
\endverbatim
where <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are arrays of numerical type.  The result <tt>Y</tt> depends
on which of the following three situations applies to the arguments
<tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>:
<OL>
  <LI> <tt>A</tt> is a scalar, <tt>B</tt> is an arbitrary <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is the scalar <tt>A</tt> divided into each element of <tt>B</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>B</tt> is a scalar, <tt>A</tt> is an arbitrary <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array, in which case the output is each element of <tt>A</tt> divided by the scalar <tt>B</tt>.
</LI>
  <LI> <tt>A,B</tt> are matrices with the same number of columns, i.e., <tt>A</tt> is of size <tt>K x M</tt>, and <tt>B</tt> is of size <tt>L x M</tt>, in which case the output is of size <tt>K x L</tt>.
</LI>
</OL>
The output follows the standard type promotion rules, although in the first two cases, if <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are integers, the output is an integer also, while in the third case if <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are integers, the output is of type <tt>double</tt>.

\section Function Internals
There are three formulae for the times operator.  For the first form
\f[
Y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{A}{B(m_1,\ldots,m_d)},
\f]
and the second form
\f[
Y(m_1,\ldots,m_d) = \frac{A(m_1,\ldots,m_d)}{B}.
\f]
In the third form, the output is defined as:
\f[
  Y = (B' \backslash A')'
\f]
and is used in the equation <tt>Y B = A</tt>.
\section Examples
The right-divide operator is much less frequently used than the left-divide operator, but the concepts are similar.  It can be used to find least-squares and minimum norm solutions.  It can also be used to solve systems of equations in much the same way.  Here's a simple example:

\if FRAGMENT
frag_operators_rightdivide_000.m
0
B = [1,1;0,1];
A = [4,5]
A/B
\endif


\verbinclude frag_operators_rightdivide_000.m.out
