Section: \ref sec_glwin "OpenGL Models"
\section Usage
Define a GL Node.  A GL Node is an object that can be displayed
in a GL Window.  It is defined by a triangular mesh of vertices.
It must also have a material that defines its appearance (i.e.
color, shininess, etc.).  The syntax for the <tt>glnode</tt> command
is 
\verbatim
  glnode(name,material,pointset)  
\endverbatim
where <tt>material</tt> is the name of a material that has already been
defined with <tt>gldefmaterial</tt>, <tt>pointset</tt> is a <tt>3 x N</tt> matrix
of points that define the geometry of the object.  Note that the points
are assumed to be connected in triangular facts, with the points
defined counter clock-wise as seen from the outside of the facet.
<tt>FreeMat</tt> will compute the normals.  The <tt>name</tt> argument must
be unique.  If you want multiple instances of a given <tt>glnode</tt>
in your GLWindow, that is fine, as instances of a <tt>glnode</tt> are
created through a <tt>glassembly</tt>.
