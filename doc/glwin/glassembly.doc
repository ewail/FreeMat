<p>
Section: \ref sec_glwin "OpenGL Models"
\section Usage
Define a GL Assembly.  A GL Assembly consists of one or more
GL Nodes or GL Assemblies that are placed relative to the 
coordinate system of the assembly.  For example, if we have
<tt>glnode</tt> definitions for <tt>'bread'</tt> and <tt>'cheese'</tt>, then
a <tt>glassembly</tt> of sandwich would consist of placements of
two <tt>'bread'</tt> nodes with a <tt>'cheese'</tt> node in between.
Furthermore, a <tt>'lunch'</tt> assembly could consist of a <tt>'sandwich'</tt>
a <tt>'chips'</tt> and <tt>'soda'</tt>.  Hopefully, you get the idea.  The
syntax for the <tt>glassembly</tt> command is
\verbatim
   glassembly(name,part1,transform1,part2,transform2,...)
\endverbatim
where <tt>part1</tt> is the name of the first part, and could be
either a <tt>glnode</tt> or itself be another <tt>glassembly</tt>.  
Here <tt>transform1</tt> is the <tt>4 x 4 matrix</tt> that transforms
the part into the local reference coordinate system.

WARNING!! Currently FreeMat does not detect or gracefully handle 
self-referential assemblies (i.e, if you try to make a <tt>sandwich</tt> 
contain a <tt>sandwich</tt>, which you can do by devious methods that I 
refuse to explain).  Do not do this!  You have been warned.
