\section Usage
 vtkDataSet is an abstract class that specifies an interface for dataset
 objects. vtkDataSet also provides methods to provide informations about
 the data, such as center, bounding box, and representative length.

 In vtk a dataset consists of a structure (geometry and topology) and 
 attribute data. The structure is defined implicitly or explicitly as
 a collection of cells. The geometry of the structure is contained in
 point coordinates plus the cell interpolation functions. The topology
 of the dataset structure is defined by cell types and how the cells
 share their defining points. 

 Attribute data in vtk is either point data (data at points) or cell data
 (data at cells). Typically filters operate on point data, but some may
 operate on cell data, both cell and point data, either one, or none.

To create an instance of class vtkDataSet, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDataSet
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkDataSet has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkDataSet class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataSet = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataSet = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CopyStructure (vtkDataSet ds)</tt> -  Copy the geometric and topological structure of an object. Note that
 the invoking object and the object pointed to by the parameter ds must
 be of the same type.
 THIS METHOD IS NOT THREAD SAFE.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CopyAttributes (vtkDataSet ds)</tt> -  Copy the attributes associated with the specified dataset to this
 instance of vtkDataSet.
 THIS METHOD IS NOT THREAD SAFE.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkIdType = obj.GetNumberOfPoints ()</tt> -  Determine the number of points composing the dataset.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkIdType = obj.GetNumberOfCells ()</tt> -  Determine the number of cells composing the dataset.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetPoint (vtkIdType ptId)</tt> -  Get point coordinates with ptId such that: 0 <= ptId < NumberOfPoints.
 THIS METHOD IS NOT THREAD SAFE.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetPoint (vtkIdType id, double x[3])</tt> -  Copy point coordinates into user provided array x[3] for specified
 point id.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE IF FIRST CALLED FROM A SINGLE THREAD AND
 THE DATASET IS NOT MODIFIED
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCell = obj.GetCell (vtkIdType cellId)</tt> -  Get cell with cellId such that: 0 <= cellId < NumberOfCells.
 THIS METHOD IS NOT THREAD SAFE.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetCell (vtkIdType cellId, vtkGenericCell cell)</tt> -  Get cell with cellId such that: 0 <= cellId < NumberOfCells. 
 This is a thread-safe alternative to the previous GetCell()
 method.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE IF FIRST CALLED FROM A SINGLE THREAD AND
 THE DATASET IS NOT MODIFIED
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetCellBounds (vtkIdType cellId, double bounds[6])</tt> -  Get the bounds of the cell with cellId such that:
     0 <= cellId < NumberOfCells.
 A subclass may be able to determine the bounds of cell without using
 an expensive GetCell() method. A default implementation is provided
 that actually uses a GetCell() call.  This is to ensure the method
 is available to all datasets.  Subclasses should override this method
 to provide an efficient implementation.

 THE DATASET IS NOT MODIFIED
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetCellType (vtkIdType cellId)</tt> -  Get type of cell with cellId such that: 0 <= cellId < NumberOfCells.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE IF FIRST CALLED FROM A SINGLE THREAD AND
 THE DATASET IS NOT MODIFIED
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetCellTypes (vtkCellTypes types)</tt> -  Get a list of types of cells in a dataset. The list consists of an array
 of types (not necessarily in any order), with a single entry per type.
 For example a dataset 5 triangles, 3 lines, and 100 hexahedra would
 result a list of three entries, corresponding to the types VTK_TRIANGLE,
 VTK_LINE, and VTK_HEXAHEDRON.
 THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE IF FIRST CALLED FROM A SINGLE THREAD AND
 THE DATASET IS NOT MODIFIED

 This method returns 1 if there is a mismatch,
 and 0 if everything is ok.  It prints an error if an
 array is too short, and a warning if an array is too long.

 in addition to the case of FIELD, which will return the field data
 for any vtkDataObject subclass.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkIdType = obj.GetNumberOfElements (int type)</tt> -  Get the number of elements for a specific attribute type (POINT, CELL, etc.).
 </LI>
