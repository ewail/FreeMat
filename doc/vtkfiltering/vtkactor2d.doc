Section: \ref sec_vtkfiltering "Visualization Toolkit Filtering Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkActor2D is similar to vtkActor, but it is made to be used with two
 dimensional images and annotation.  vtkActor2D has a position but does not
 use a transformation matrix like vtkActor (see the superclass vtkProp
 for information on positioning vtkActor2D).  vtkActor2D has a reference to
 a vtkMapper2D object which does the rendering.

To create an instance of class vtkActor2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkActor2D
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkActor2D has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkActor2D class.

<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>

<LI>  <tt>vtkActor2D = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkActor2D = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.RenderOverlay (vtkViewport viewport)</tt> -  Support the standard render methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.RenderOpaqueGeometry (vtkViewport viewport)</tt> -  Support the standard render methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.RenderTranslucentPolygonalGeometry (vtkViewport viewport)</tt> -  Support the standard render methods.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.HasTranslucentPolygonalGeometry ()</tt> -  Does this prop have some translucent polygonal geometry?
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetMapper (vtkMapper2D mapper)</tt> -  Set/Get the vtkMapper2D which defines the data to be drawn.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkMapper2D = obj.GetMapper ()</tt> -  Set/Get the vtkMapper2D which defines the data to be drawn.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLayerNumber (int )</tt> -  Set/Get the layer number in the overlay planes into which to render.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetLayerNumber ()</tt> -  Set/Get the layer number in the overlay planes into which to render.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkProperty2D = obj.GetProperty ()</tt> -  Returns this actor's vtkProperty2D.  Creates a property if one
 doesn't already exist.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProperty (vtkProperty2D )</tt> -  Set this vtkProp's vtkProperty2D.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCoordinate = obj.GetPositionCoordinate ()</tt> -  Get the PositionCoordinate instance of vtkCoordinate.
 This is used for for complicated or relative positioning.
 The position variable controls the lower left corner of the Actor2D
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition (double, double)</tt> -  Get the PositionCoordinate instance of vtkCoordinate.
 This is used for for complicated or relative positioning.
 The position variable controls the lower left corner of the Actor2D
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition (double a[2])</tt> -  Get the PositionCoordinate instance of vtkCoordinate.
 This is used for for complicated or relative positioning.
 The position variable controls the lower left corner of the Actor2D
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetPosition ()</tt> -  Get the PositionCoordinate instance of vtkCoordinate.
 This is used for for complicated or relative positioning.
 The position variable controls the lower left corner of the Actor2D
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetDisplayPosition (int , int )</tt> -  Set the Prop2D's position in display coordinates.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCoordinate = obj.GetPosition2Coordinate ()</tt> -  Access the Position2 instance variable. This variable controls
 the upper right corner of the Actor2D. It is by default
 relative to Position and in normalized viewport coordinates.
 Some 2D actor subclasses ignore the position2 variable
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition2 (double, double)</tt> -  Access the Position2 instance variable. This variable controls
 the upper right corner of the Actor2D. It is by default
 relative to Position and in normalized viewport coordinates.
 Some 2D actor subclasses ignore the position2 variable
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetPosition2 (double a[2])</tt> -  Access the Position2 instance variable. This variable controls
 the upper right corner of the Actor2D. It is by default
 relative to Position and in normalized viewport coordinates.
 Some 2D actor subclasses ignore the position2 variable
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetPosition2 ()</tt> -  Access the Position2 instance variable. This variable controls
 the upper right corner of the Actor2D. It is by default
 relative to Position and in normalized viewport coordinates.
 Some 2D actor subclasses ignore the position2 variable
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetWidth (double w)</tt> -  Set/Get the height and width of the Actor2D. The value is expressed
 as a fraction of the viewport. This really is just another way of
 setting the Position2 instance variable.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetWidth ()</tt> -  Set/Get the height and width of the Actor2D. The value is expressed
 as a fraction of the viewport. This really is just another way of
 setting the Position2 instance variable.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetHeight (double h)</tt> -  Set/Get the height and width of the Actor2D. The value is expressed
 as a fraction of the viewport. This really is just another way of
 setting the Position2 instance variable.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetHeight ()</tt> -  Set/Get the height and width of the Actor2D. The value is expressed
 as a fraction of the viewport. This really is just another way of
 setting the Position2 instance variable.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>long = obj.GetMTime ()</tt> -  Return this objects MTime.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.GetActors2D (vtkPropCollection pc)</tt> -  For some exporters and other other operations we must be
 able to collect all the actors or volumes. These methods
 are used in that process.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ShallowCopy (vtkProp prop)</tt> -  Shallow copy of this vtkActor2D. Overloads the virtual vtkProp method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ReleaseGraphicsResources (vtkWindow )</tt> -  Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
 The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
 resources to release.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCoordinate = obj.GetActualPositionCoordinate (void )</tt> -  Return the actual vtkCoordinate reference that the mapper should use
 to position the actor. This is used internally by the mappers and should
 be overridden in specialized subclasses and otherwise ignored.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCoordinate = obj.GetActualPosition2Coordinate (void )</tt>
 </LI>
</UL>
