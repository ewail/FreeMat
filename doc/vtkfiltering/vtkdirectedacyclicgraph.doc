\section Usage
 vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph is a connected directed graph with no cycles. A tree is a type of
 directed graph, so works with all graph algorithms.

 vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph is a read-only data structure.
 To construct a tree, create an instance of vtkMutableDirectedGraph.
 Add vertices and edges with AddVertex() and AddEdge(). You may alternately
 start by adding a single vertex as the root then call graph->AddChild(parent)
 which adds a new vertex and connects the parent to the child.
 The tree MUST have all edges in the proper direction, from parent to child.
 After building the tree, call tree->CheckedShallowCopy(graph) to copy the
 structure into a vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph. This method will return false if the graph is
 an invalid tree.

 vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph provides some convenience methods for obtaining the parent and
 children of a vertex, for finding the root, and determining if a vertex
 is a leaf (a vertex with no children).


To create an instance of class vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph has several methods that can be used.
