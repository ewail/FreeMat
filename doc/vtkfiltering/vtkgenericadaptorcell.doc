\section Usage
 In VTK, spatial-temporal data is defined in terms of a dataset which is
 composed of cells. The cells are topological entities over which an 
 interpolation field is applied. Cells are defined in terms of a topology
 (e.g., vertices, lines, triangles, polygons, tetrahedra, etc.), points
 that instantiate the geometry of the cells, and interpolation fields
 (in the general case one interpolation field is for geometry, the other
 is for attribute data associated with the cell).

 Currently most algorithms in VTK use vtkCell and vtkDataSet, which make 
 assumptions about the nature of datasets, cells, and attributes. In
 particular, this abstraction assumes that cell interpolation functions
 are linear, or products of linear functions. Further, VTK implements
 most of the interpolation functions. This implementation starts breaking
 down as the complexity of the interpolation (or basis) functions
 increases. 

 vtkGenericAdaptorCell addresses these issues by providing more general
 abstraction for cells. It also adopts modern C++ practices including using
 iterators. The vtkGenericAdaptorCell is designed to fit within the adaptor
 framework; meaning that it is meant to adapt VTK to external simulation
 systems (see the GenericFiltering/README.html).

 Please note that most cells are defined in terms of other cells (the
 boundary cells). They are also defined in terms of points, which are
 not the same as vertices (vertices are a 0-D cell; points represent a
 position in space).

 Another important concept is the notion of DOFNodes. These concept
 supports cell types with complex interpolation functions. For example,
 higher-order p-method finite elements may have different functions on each
 of their topological features (edges, faces, region). The coefficients of
 these polynomial functions are associated with DOFNodes. (There is a
 single DOFNode for each topological feature.) Note that from this
 perspective, points are used to establish the topological form of the 
 cell; mid-side nodes and such are considered DOFNodes.

To create an instance of class vtkGenericAdaptorCell, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkGenericAdaptorCell
\endverbatim

 greater than 0 and less than GetDimension() if -1) of the cell.
 When \a dim is -1, the number of vertices is not included in the

 at most a single field value associated with it; DOF nodes may have
 an arbitrary number of field values associated with them.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetNumberOfDOFNodes ()</tt> -  Accumulated number of DOF nodes of the current cell. A DOF node is
 a component of cell with a given topological dimension. e.g.: a triangle
 has 4 DOF: 1 face and 3 edges. An hexahedron has 19 DOF:
 1 region, 6 faces, and 12 edges.

 The number of vertices is not included in the
 count because vertices are a special case: a vertex will have
 at most a single field value associated with it; DOF nodes may have

 respect to an implicit function `f'. Contouring is performed on the
 scalar attribute (`attributes->GetActiveAttribute()'
 `attributes->GetActiveComponent()').  Contouring interpolates the
 `attributes->GetNumberOfattributesToInterpolate()' attributes
 `attributes->GetAttributesToInterpolate()'.  The `locator', `verts',
 `lines', `polys', `outPd' and `outCd' are cumulative data arrays over
 cell iterations: they store the result of each call to Contour():
 - `locator' is a points list that merges points as they are inserted
  (i.e., prevents duplicates).
 - `verts' is an array of generated vertices
 - `lines' is an array of generated lines
 - `polys' is an array of generated polygons
 - `outPd' is an array of interpolated point data along the edge (if
 not-NULL)
 - `outCd' is an array of copied cell data of the current cell (if 
 not-NULL)
 `internalPd', `secondaryPd' and `secondaryCd' are initialized by the
 filter that call it from `attributes'.
 - `internalPd' stores the result of the tessellation pass: the
 higher-order cell is tessellated into linear sub-cells.
 - `secondaryPd' and `secondaryCd' are used internally as inputs to the
 Contour() method on linear sub-cells.
 Note: the CopyAllocate() method must be invoked on both `outPd' and
 `outCd', from `secondaryPd' and `secondaryCd'.

 NOTE: `vtkGenericAttributeCollection *attributes' will be replaced by a
       `vtkInformation'.

 the `value' or the implicit function `f' of the scalar attribute
 (`attributes->GetActiveAttribute()',`attributes->GetActiveComponent()').
 If `f' exists, `value' is not used. The output is the part of the
 current cell which is inside the contour.  The output is a set of zero,
 one or more cells of the same topological dimension as the current
 cell. Normally, cell points whose scalar value is greater than "value"
 are considered inside. If `insideOut' is on, this is reversed.  Clipping
 interpolates the `attributes->GetNumberOfattributesToInterpolate()'
 attributes `attributes->GetAttributesToInterpolate()'.  `locator',
 `connectivity', `outPd' and `outCd' are cumulative data arrays over cell
 iterations: they store the result of each call to Clip():
 - `locator' is a points list that merges points as they are inserted
 (i.e., prevents duplicates).
 - `connectivity' is an array of generated cells
 - `outPd' is an array of interpolated point data along the edge (if
 not-NULL)
 - `outCd' is an array of copied cell data of the current cell (if
 not-NULL)
 `internalPd', `secondaryPd' and `secondaryCd' are initialized by the
 filter that call it from `attributes'.

 primary cell) and parametric coordinates `pcoords'.
 Derivatives are in the x-y-z coordinate directions for each data value.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj.GetParametricDistance (double pcoords[3])</tt> -  Return the distance of the parametric coordinate `pcoords' to the
 current cell.  If inside the cell, a distance of zero is returned. This
 is used during picking to get the correct cell picked. (The tolerance
 will occasionally allow cells to be picked who are not really
 intersected "inside" the cell.)  \post positive_result: result>=0

 `attributes' is not linear. The output are linear cells of the same
 dimension than the cell. If the cell is linear and all attributes are
 linear, the output is just a copy of the current cell.
 `points', `cellArray', `pd' and `cd' are cumulative output data arrays
 over cell iterations: they store the result of each call to Tessellate().
 `internalPd' is initialized by the calling filter and stores the
 result of the tessellation.
 If it is not null, `types' is filled with the types of the linear cells.
 `types' is null when it is called from vtkGenericGeometryFilter and not
 null when it is called from vtkGenericDatasetTessellator.
