Section: \ref sec_vtkfiltering "Visualization Toolkit Filtering Classes"
\section Usage
 vtkAlgorithmOutput is a proxy object returned by the GetOutputPort
 method of vtkAlgorithm.  It may be passed to the
 SetInputConnection, AddInputConnection, or RemoveInputConnection
 methods of another vtkAlgorithm to establish a connection between
 an output and input port.  The connection is not stored in the
 proxy object: it is simply a convenience for creating or removing
 connections.

To create an instance of class vtkAlgorithmOutput, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkAlgorithmOutput
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkAlgorithmOutput has several methods that can be used.
