\section Usage
 vtkCellData is a class that is used to represent and manipulate
 cell attribute data (e.g., scalars, vectors, normals, texture 
 coordinates, etc.) Special methods are provided to work with filter
 objects, such as passing data through filter, copying data from one 
 cell to another, and interpolating data given cell interpolation weights.

To create an instance of class vtkCellData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCellData
\endverbatim
