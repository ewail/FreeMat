\section Usage
 vtkPolyDataToPolyDataFilter is an abstract filter class whose subclasses
 take as input polygonal data and generate polygonal data on output.
 .SECTION Warning
 This used to be the parent class for most polydata filter in VTK4.x, now 
 this role has been replaced by vtkPolyDataAlgorithm. You should consider
 using vtkPolyDataAlgorithm instead of this class, 
 when writing filter for VTK5 and above.
 This class was kept to ensure full backward compatibility.

To create an instance of class vtkPolyDataToPolyDataFilter, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPolyDataToPolyDataFilter
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkPolyDataToPolyDataFilter has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
