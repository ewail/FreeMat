\section Usage
 vtkParametricSpline is a parametric function for 1D interpolating splines.
 vtkParametricSpline maps the single parameter u into a 3D point (x,y,z)
 using three instances of interpolating splines.  This family of 1D splines
 is quaranteed to be parameterized in the interval [0,1].  Attempting to
 evaluate outside this interval will cause the parameter u to be clamped in
 the range [0,1].

 When constructed, this class creates instances of vtkCardinalSpline for
 each of the x-y-z coordinates. The user may choose to replace these with
 their own instances of subclasses of vtkSpline.


To create an instance of class vtkParametricSpline, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkParametricSpline
\endverbatim
