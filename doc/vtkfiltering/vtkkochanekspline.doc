\section Usage
 Implements the Kochenek interpolating spline described in: Kochanek, D.,
 Bartels, R., "Interpolating Splines with Local Tension, Continuity, and
 Bias Control," Computer Graphics, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 33-41, July 1984.
 These splines give the user more control over the shape of the curve than
 the cardinal splines implemented in vtkCardinalSpline. Three parameters
 can be specified. All have a range from -1 to 1.
 
 Tension controls how sharply the curve bends at an input point. A
 value of -1 produces more slack in the curve. A value of 1 tightens
 the curve.
 
 Continuity controls the continuity of the first derivative at input
 points. 
 
 Bias controls the direction of the curve at it passes through an input
 point. A value of -1 undershoots the point while a value of 1
 overshoots the point.
 
 These three parameters give the user broad control over the shape of
 the interpolating spline. The original Kochanek paper describes the
 effects nicely and is recommended reading.

To create an instance of class vtkKochanekSpline, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkKochanekSpline
\endverbatim
