\section Usage
 vtkImageData is a data object that is a concrete implementation of
 vtkDataSet. vtkImageData represents a geometric structure that is
 a topological and geometrical regular array of points. Examples include
 volumes (voxel data) and pixmaps.

To create an instance of class vtkImageData, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImageData
\endverbatim

 vectors are arranged corresponds to the ordering of the voxel points.

 The dataset extent does not have to start at (0,0,0). (0,0,0) is just the
