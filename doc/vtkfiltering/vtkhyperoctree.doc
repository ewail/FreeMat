\section Usage
 An hyperoctree is a dataset where each node has either exactly 2^n children
 or no child at all if the node is a leaf. `n' is the dimension of the
 dataset (1 (binary tree), 2 (quadtree) or 3 (octree) ).
 The class name comes from the following paper:

 \verbatim
 @ARTICLE{yau-srihari-1983,
  author={Mann-May Yau and Sargur N. Srihari},
  title={A Hierarchical Data Structure for Multidimensional Digital Images},
  journal={Communications of the ACM},
  month={July},
  year={1983},
  volume={26},
  number={7},
  pages={504--515}
  }
 \endverbatim

 Each node is a cell. Attributes are associated with cells, not with points.
 The geometry is implicitly given by the size of the root node on each axis
 and position of the center and the orientation. (TODO: review center
 position and orientation). The geometry is then not limited to an hybercube
 but can have a rectangular shape.
 Attributes are associated with leaves. For LOD (Level-Of-Detail) purpose,
 attributes can be computed on none-leaf nodes by computing the average
 values from its children (which can be leaves or not).

 By construction, an hyperoctree is efficient in memory usage when the
 geometry is sparse. The LOD feature allows to cull quickly part of the
 dataset.

 A couple of filters can be applied on this dataset: contour, outline,
 geometry.

 * 3D case (octree)
 for each node, each child index (from 0 to 7) is encoded in the following
 orientation. It is easy to access each child as a cell of a grid.
 Note also that the binary representation is relevant, each bit code a
 side: bit 0 encodes -x side (0) or +x side (1)
 bit 1 encodes -y side (0) or +y side (1)
 bit 2 encodes -z side (0) or +z side (2)
 - the -z side first
 - 0: -y -x sides
 - 1: -y +x sides
 - 2: +y -x sides
 - 3: +y +x sides
 \verbatim
              +y
 +-+-+        ^
 |2|3|        |
 +-+-+  O +z  +-> +x
 |0|1|
 +-+-+
 \endverbatim

 - then the +z side, in counter-clockwise
 - 4: -y -x sides
 - 5: -y +x sides
 - 6: +y -x sides
 - 7: +y +x sides
 \verbatim
              +y
 +-+-+        ^
 |6|7|        |
 +-+-+  O +z  +-> +x
 |4|5|
 +-+-+
 \endverbatim

 The cases with fewer dimensions are consistent with the octree case:

 * Quadtree:
 in counter-clockwise
 - 0: -y -x edges
 - 1: -y +x edges
 - 2: +y -x edges
 - 3: +y +x edges
 \verbatim
         +y
 +-+-+   ^
 |2|3|   |
 +-+-+  O+-> +x
 |0|1|
 +-+-+
 \endverbatim

 * Binary tree:
 \verbatim
 +0+1+  O+-> +x
 \endverbatim
