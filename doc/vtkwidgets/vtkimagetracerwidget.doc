\section Usage
 vtkImageTracerWidget is different from other widgets in three distinct ways:
 1) any sub-class of vtkProp can be input rather than just vtkProp3D, so that
 vtkImageActor can be set as the prop and then traced over, 2) the widget fires
 pick events at the input prop to decide where to move its handles, 3) the
 widget has 2D glyphs for handles instead of 3D spheres as is done in other
 sub-classes of vtk3DWidget. This widget is primarily designed for manually
 tracing over image data.
 The button actions and key modifiers are as follows for controlling the
 widget:
 1) left button click over the image, hold and drag draws a free hand line.
 2) left button click and release erases the widget line,
 if it exists, and repositions the first handle.
 3) middle button click starts a snap drawn line.  The line is terminated by 
 clicking the middle button while depressing the ctrl key.
 4) when tracing a continuous or snap drawn line, if the last cursor position
 is within a specified tolerance to the first handle, the widget line will form
 a closed loop.
 5) right button clicking and holding on any handle that is part of a snap
 drawn line allows handle dragging: existing line segments are updated
 accordingly.  If the path is open and AutoClose is set to On, the path can
 be closed by repositioning the first and last points over one another.
 6) ctrl key + right button down on any handle will erase it: existing
 snap drawn line segments are updated accordingly.  If the line was formed by
 continous tracing, the line is deleted leaving one handle.
 7) shift key + right button down on any snap drawn line segment will insert
 a handle at the cursor position.  The line segment is split accordingly.

To create an instance of class vtkImageTracerWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
