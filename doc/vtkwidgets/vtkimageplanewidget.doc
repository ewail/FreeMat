\section Usage
 This 3D widget defines a plane that can be interactively placed in an
 image volume. A nice feature of the object is that the
 vtkImagePlaneWidget, like any 3D widget, will work with the current
 interactor style. That is, if vtkImagePlaneWidget does not handle an
 event, then all other registered observers (including the interactor
 style) have an opportunity to process the event. Otherwise, the
 vtkImagePlaneWidget will terminate the processing of the event that it
 handles.

 The core functionality of the widget is provided by a vtkImageReslice
 object which passes its output onto a texture mapping pipeline for fast
 slicing through volumetric data. See the key methods: GenerateTexturePlane()
 and UpdatePlane() for implementation details.

 To use this object, just invoke SetInteractor() with the argument of the
 method a vtkRenderWindowInteractor.  You may also wish to invoke
 "PlaceWidget()" to initially position the widget. If the "i" key (for
 "interactor") is pressed, the vtkImagePlaneWidget will appear. (See
 superclass documentation for information about changing this behavior.)

 Selecting the widget with the middle mouse button with and without holding
 the shift or control keys enables complex reslicing capablilites.
 To facilitate use, a set of 'margins' (left, right, top, bottom) are shown as
 a set of plane-axes aligned lines, the properties of which can be changed
 as a group.
 Without keyboard modifiers: selecting in the middle of the margins
 enables translation of the plane along its normal. Selecting one of the
 corners within the margins enables spinning around the plane's normal at its
 center.  Selecting within a margin allows rotating about the center of the
 plane around an axis aligned with the margin (i.e., selecting left margin
 enables rotating around the plane's local y-prime axis).
 With control key modifier: margin selection enables edge translation (i.e., a
 constrained form of scaling). Selecting within the margins enables
 translation of the entire plane.
 With shift key modifier: uniform plane scaling is enabled.  Moving the mouse
 up enlarges the plane while downward movement shrinks it.

 Window-level is achieved by using the right mouse button.  Window-level
 values can be reset by shift + 'r' or control + 'r' while regular reset
 camera is maintained with 'r' or 'R'.
 The left mouse button can be used to query the underlying image data
 with a snap-to cross-hair cursor.  Currently, the nearest point in the input
 image data to the mouse cursor generates the cross-hairs.  With oblique
 slicing, this behaviour may appear unsatisfactory. Text display of
 window-level and image coordinates/data values are provided by a text
 actor/mapper pair.

 Events that occur outside of the widget (i.e., no part of the widget is
 picked) are propagated to any other registered obsevers (such as the
 interaction style). Turn off the widget by pressing the "i" key again
 (or invoke the Off() method). To support interactive manipulation of
 objects, this class invokes the events StartInteractionEvent,
 InteractionEvent, and EndInteractionEvent as well as StartWindowLevelEvent,
 WindowLevelEvent, EndWindowLevelEvent and ResetWindowLevelEvent.

 The vtkImagePlaneWidget has several methods that can be used in
 conjunction with other VTK objects. The GetPolyData() method can be used
 to get the polygonal representation of the plane and can be used as input
 for other VTK objects. Typical usage of the widget is to make use of the
 StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and EndInteractionEvent
 events. The InteractionEvent is called on mouse motion; the other two
 events are called on button down and button up (either left or right
 button).

 Some additional features of this class include the ability to control the
 properties of the widget. You can set the properties of: the selected and
 unselected representations of the plane's outline; the text actor via its
 vtkTextProperty; the cross-hair cursor. In addition there are methods to
 constrain the plane so that it is aligned along the x-y-z axes.  Finally,
 one can specify the degree of interpolation (vtkImageReslice): nearest
 neighbour, linear, and cubic.

To create an instance of class vtkImagePlaneWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkImagePlaneWidget

 you can bind the left button action to VTK_SLICE_MOTION_ACTION (see above) 
 and the left button auto modifier to VTK_CONTROL_MODIFIER: you end up with
 the left button controling panning without pressing a key.
