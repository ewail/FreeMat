Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class serves as the geometrical representation of a vtkHandleWidget. 
 The handle can be represented by an arbitrary polygonal data (vtkPolyData),
 set via SetHandle(vtkPolyData *). The actual position of the handle 
 will be initially assumed to be (0,0,0). You can specify an offset from
 this position if desired.

To create an instance of class vtkPolygonalHandleRepresentation3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkPolygonalHandleRepresentation3D
\endverbatim
