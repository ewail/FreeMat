\section Usage
 The vtkContourRepresentation is a superclass for various types of
 representations for the vtkContourWidget.

 .SECTION Managing contour points
 The classes vtkContourRepresentationNode, vtkContourRepresentationInternals, 
 vtkContourRepresentationPoint manage the data structure used to represent 
 nodes and points on a contour. A contour may contain several nodes and 
 several more points. Nodes are usually the result of user clicked points on
 the contour. Additional points are created between nodes to generate a 
 smooth curve using some Interpolator. See the method \c SetLineInterpolator.
 \par
 The data structure stores both the world and display positions for every 
 point. (This may seem like a duplication.) The default behaviour of this 
 class is to use the WorldPosition to do all the math. Typically a point is
 added at a given display position. Its corresponding world position is 
 computed using the point placer and stored. Any query of the display 
 position of a stored point is done via the Renderer, which computes the 
 display position given a world position. 
 
 \par 
 So why maintain the display position ? Consider drawing a contour on a 
 volume widget. You might want the contour to be located at a certain world
 position in the volume or you might want to be overlayed over the window 
 like an Actor2D. The default behaviour of this class is to provide the 
 former behaviour. 

 \par
 To achieve the latter behaviour override the methods that return the display 
 position (to return the set display position instead of computing it from
 the world positions) and the method \c BuildLines() to interpolate lines 
 using their display positions intead of world positions.
