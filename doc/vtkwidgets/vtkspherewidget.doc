\section Usage
 This 3D widget defines a sphere that can be interactively placed in a
 scene. 

 To use this object, just invoke SetInteractor() with the argument of the
 method a vtkRenderWindowInteractor.  You may also wish to invoke
 "PlaceWidget()" to initially position the widget. The interactor will act
 normally until the "i" key (for "interactor") is pressed, at which point the
 vtkSphereWidget will appear. (See superclass documentation for information
 about changing this behavior.) 
 Events that occur outside of the widget (i.e., no part of
 the widget is picked) are propagated to any other registered obsevers
 (such as the interaction style).  Turn off the widget by pressing the "i"
 key again (or invoke the Off() method).

 The vtkSphereWidget has several methods that can be used in conjunction
 with other VTK objects. The Set/GetThetaResolution() and
 Set/GetPhiResolution() methods control the number of subdivisions of the
 sphere in the theta and phi directions; the GetPolyData() method can be
 used to get the polygonal representation and can be used for things like
 seeding streamlines. The GetSphere() method returns a sphere implicit
 function that can be used for cutting and clipping. Typical usage of the
 widget is to make use of the StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and
 EndInteractionEvent events. The InteractionEvent is called on mouse
 motion; the other two events are called on button down and button up
 (any mouse button).

 Some additional features of this class include the ability to control the
 properties of the widget. You can set the properties of the selected and
 unselected representations of the sphere. 

To create an instance of class vtkSphereWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSphereWidget
\endverbatim
