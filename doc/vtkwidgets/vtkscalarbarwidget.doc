<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class provides support for interactively manipulating the position,
 size, and orientation of a scalar bar. It listens to Left mouse events and
 mouse movement. It also listens to Right mouse events and notifies any 
 observers of Right mouse events on this object when they occur.
 It will change the cursor shape based on its location. If
 the cursor is over an edge of the scalar bar it will change the cursor
 shape to a resize edge shape. If the position of a scalar bar is moved to
 be close to the center of one of the four edges of the viewport, then the
 scalar bar will change its orientation to align with that edge. This
 orientation is sticky in that it will stay that orientation until the
 position is moved close to another edge.

To create an instance of class vtkScalarBarWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkScalarBarWidget
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkScalarBarWidget has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkScalarBarWidget class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkScalarBarWidget = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkScalarBarWidget = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRepresentation (vtkScalarBarRepresentation rep)</tt> -  Specify an instance of vtkWidgetRepresentation used to represent this
 widget in the scene. Note that the representation is a subclass of vtkProp
 so it can be added to the renderer independent of the widget.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkScalarBarRepresentation = obj.GetScalarBarRepresentation ()</tt> -  Get the ScalarBar used by this Widget. One is created automatically.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetScalarBarActor (vtkScalarBarActor actor)</tt> -  Get the ScalarBar used by this Widget. One is created automatically.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkScalarBarActor = obj.GetScalarBarActor ()</tt> -  Get the ScalarBar used by this Widget. One is created automatically.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRepositionable (int )</tt> -  Can the widget be moved. On by default. If off, the widget cannot be moved
 around.

 TODO: This functionality should probably be moved to the superclass.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetRepositionable ()</tt> -  Can the widget be moved. On by default. If off, the widget cannot be moved
 around.

 TODO: This functionality should probably be moved to the superclass.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.RepositionableOn ()</tt> -  Can the widget be moved. On by default. If off, the widget cannot be moved
 around.

 TODO: This functionality should probably be moved to the superclass.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.RepositionableOff ()</tt> -  Can the widget be moved. On by default. If off, the widget cannot be moved
 around.

 TODO: This functionality should probably be moved to the superclass.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CreateDefaultRepresentation ()</tt> -  Create the default widget representation if one is not set. 
 </LI>
</UL>
