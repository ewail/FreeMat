\section Usage
 This 3D widget defines a spline that can be interactively placed in a
 scene. The spline has handles, the number of which can be changed, plus it
 can be picked on the spline itself to translate or rotate it in the scene.
 A nice feature of the object is that the vtkSplineWidget, like any 3D
 widget, will work with the current interactor style. That is, if
 vtkSplineWidget does not handle an event, then all other registered
 observers (including the interactor style) have an opportunity to process
 the event. Otherwise, the vtkSplineWidget will terminate the processing of
 the event that it handles.

 To use this object, just invoke SetInteractor() with the argument of the
 method a vtkRenderWindowInteractor.  You may also wish to invoke
 "PlaceWidget()" to initially position the widget. The interactor will act
 normally until the "i" key (for "interactor") is pressed, at which point the
 vtkSplineWidget will appear. (See superclass documentation for information
 about changing this behavior.) Events that occur outside of the widget
 (i.e., no part of the widget is picked) are propagated to any other
 registered obsevers (such as the interaction style).  Turn off the widget
 by pressing the "i" key again (or invoke the Off() method).

 The button actions and key modifiers are as follows for controlling the
 widget:
 1) left button down on and drag one of the spherical handles to change the
 shape of the spline: the handles act as "control points".
 2) left button or middle button down on a line segment forming the spline
 allows uniform translation of the widget.
 3) ctrl + middle button down on the widget enables spinning of the widget
 about its center.
 4) right button down on the widget enables scaling of the widget. By moving
 the mouse "up" the render window the spline will be made bigger; by moving
 "down" the render window the widget will be made smaller.
 5) ctrl key + right button down on any handle will erase it providing there
 will be two or more points remaining to form a spline.
 6) shift key + right button down on any line segment will insert a handle
 onto the spline at the cursor position.

 The vtkSplineWidget has several methods that can be used in conjunction with
 other VTK objects. The Set/GetResolution() methods control the number of
 subdivisions of the spline; the GetPolyData() method can be used to get the
 polygonal representation and can be used for things like seeding
 streamlines or probing other data sets. Typical usage of the widget is to
 make use of the StartInteractionEvent, InteractionEvent, and
 EndInteractionEvent events. The InteractionEvent is called on mouse motion;
 the other two events are called on button down and button up (either left or
 right button).

 Some additional features of this class include the ability to control the
 properties of the widget. You can set the properties of the selected and
 unselected representations of the spline. For example, you can set the
 property for the handles and spline. In addition there are methods to
 constrain the spline so that it is aligned with a plane.  Note that a simple
 ruler widget can be derived by setting the resolution to 1, the number of
 handles to 2, and calling the GetSummedLength method!

To create an instance of class vtkSplineWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

  obj = vtkSplineWidget
