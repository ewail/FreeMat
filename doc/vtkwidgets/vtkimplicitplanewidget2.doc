\section Usage
 This 3D widget defines an infinite plane that can be interactively placed
 in a scene. The widget is assumed to consist of four parts: 1) a plane
 contained in a 2) bounding box, with a 3) plane normal, which is rooted
 at a 4) point on the plane. (The representation paired with this widget
 determines the actual geometry of the widget.)

 To use this widget, you generally pair it with a vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation
 (or a subclass). Variuos options are available for controlling how the 
 representation appears, and how the widget functions.

To create an instance of class vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2
\endverbatim
