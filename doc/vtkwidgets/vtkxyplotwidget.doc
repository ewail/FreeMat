Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class provides support for interactively manipulating the position,
 size, and orientation of a XY Plot. It listens to Left mouse events and
 mouse movement. It will change the cursor shape based on its location. If
 the cursor is over an edge of thea XY plot it will change the cursor shape
 to a resize edge shape. If the position of a XY plot is moved to be close to
 the center of one of the four edges of the viewport, then the XY plot will
 change its orientation to align with that edge. This orientation is sticky
 in that it will stay that orientation until the position is moved close to
 another edge.

To create an instance of class vtkXYPlotWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkXYPlotWidget
\endverbatim
