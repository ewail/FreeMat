Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class serves as the geometrical representation of a vtkHandleWidget. 
 The handle can be represented by an arbitrary polygonal data (vtkPolyData),
 set via SetHandle(vtkPolyData *). The actual position of the handle 
 will be initially assumed to be (0,0,0). You can specify an offset from
 this position if desired. This class differs from 
 vtkPolygonalHandleRepresentation3D in that the handle will always remain
 front facing, ie it maintains a fixed orientation with respect to the 
 camera. This is done by using vtkFollowers internally to render the actors.

To create an instance of class vtkOrientedPolygonalHandleRepresentation3D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkOrientedPolygonalHandleRepresentation3D
\endverbatim
