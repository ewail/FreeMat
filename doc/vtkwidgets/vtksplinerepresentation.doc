\section Usage
 vtkSplineRepresentation is a vtkWidgetRepresentation for a spline.
 This 3D widget defines a spline that can be interactively placed in a
 scene. The spline has handles, the number of which can be changed, plus it
 can be picked on the spline itself to translate or rotate it in the scene.
 This is based on vtkSplineWidget.

To create an instance of class vtkSplineRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkSplineRepresentation
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkSplineRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkSplineRepresentation class.

 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetInteractionState (int )</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProjectToPlane (int )</tt> -  Force the spline widget to be projected onto one of the orthogonal planes.
 Remember that when the InteractionState changes, a ModifiedEvent is invoked.
 This can be used to snap the spline to the plane if it is orginally
 not aligned.  The normal in SetProjectionNormal is 0,1,2 for YZ,XZ,XY
 planes respectively and 3 for arbitrary oblique planes when the widget
 is tied to a vtkPlaneSource.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetProjectToPlane ()</tt> -  Force the spline widget to be projected onto one of the orthogonal planes.
 Remember that when the InteractionState changes, a ModifiedEvent is invoked.
 This can be used to snap the spline to the plane if it is orginally
 not aligned.  The normal in SetProjectionNormal is 0,1,2 for YZ,XZ,XY
 planes respectively and 3 for arbitrary oblique planes when the widget
 is tied to a vtkPlaneSource.
 </LI>

<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProjectionNormalToOblique ()</tt> -  Set the position of spline handles and points in terms of a plane's
 position. i.e., if ProjectionNormal is 0, all of the x-coordinate
 values of the points are set to position. Any value can be passed (and is
 ignored) to update the spline points when Projection normal is set to 3
 for arbritrary plane orientations.

 for arbritrary plane orientations.

 polydata consists of points and line segments numbering Resolution + 1
 and Resoltuion, respectively. Points are guaranteed to be up-to-date when

 user provides the vtkPolyData and the points and polyline are added to it.

 three are of the same type.

 user supplied subclasses of vtkSpline.

 instance.  If the first and last points are the same, the spline sets
 Closed to the on InteractionState and disregards the last point, otherwise Closed
