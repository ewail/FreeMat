Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 The vtkCheckerboardWidget is used to interactively control an instance of
 vtkImageCheckerboard (and an associated vtkImageActor used to display the
 checkerboard). The user can adjust the number of divisions in each of the
 i-j directions in a 2D image. A frame appears around the vtkImageActor
 with sliders along each side of the frame. The user can interactively
 adjust the sliders to the desired number of checkerboard subdivisions.
 
 To use this widget, specify an instance of vtkImageCheckerboard and an
 instance of vtkImageActor. By default, the widget responds to the
 following events:
 <pre>
 If the slider bead is selected:
   LeftButtonPressEvent - select slider (if on slider)
   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release slider 
   MouseMoveEvent - move slider
 If the end caps or slider tube of a slider are selected:
   LeftButtonPressEvent - jump (or animate) to cap or point on tube;
 </pre>
 It is possible to change these event bindings. Please refer to the
 documentation for vtkSliderWidget for more information. Advanced users may
 directly access and manipulate the sliders by obtaining the instances of
 vtkSliderWidget composing the vtkCheckerboard widget. 

To create an instance of class vtkCheckerboardWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkCheckerboardWidget
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkCheckerboardWidget has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkCheckerboardWidget class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt> -  Standard methods for a VTK class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt> -  Standard methods for a VTK class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCheckerboardWidget = obj.NewInstance ()</tt> -  Standard methods for a VTK class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkCheckerboardWidget = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt> -  Standard methods for a VTK class.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetEnabled (int )</tt> -  The method for activiating and deactiviating this widget. This method
 must be overridden because it is a composite widget and does more than
 its superclasses' vtkAbstractWidget::SetEnabled() method.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRepresentation (vtkCheckerboardRepresentation r)</tt> -  Create the default widget representation if one is not set. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CreateDefaultRepresentation ()</tt> -  Create the default widget representation if one is not set. 
 </LI>
</UL>
