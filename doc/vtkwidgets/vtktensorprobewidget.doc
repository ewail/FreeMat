Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 The class is used to probe tensors on a trajectory. The representation
 (vtkTensorProbeRepresentation) is free to choose its own method of 
 rendering the tensors. For instance vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation
 renders the tensors as ellipsoids. The interactions of the widget are 
 controlled by the left mouse button. A left click on the tensor selects
 it. It can dragged around the trajectory to probe the tensors on it.
 
 For instance dragging the ellipsoid around with 
 vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation will manifest itself with the 
 ellipsoid shape changing as needed along the trajectory.

To create an instance of class vtkTensorProbeWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTensorProbeWidget
\endverbatim
