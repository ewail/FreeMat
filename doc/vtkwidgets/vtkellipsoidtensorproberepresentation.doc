\section Usage
 vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation is a concrete implementation of 
 vtkTensorProbeRepresentation. It renders tensors as ellipsoids. Locations
 between two points when probed have the tensors linearly interpolated 
 from the neighboring locations on the polyline.


To create an instance of class vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
