\section Usage
 This class is a concrete representation for the
 vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2. It represents an infinite plane defined by a
 normal and point in the context of a bounding box. Through interaction
 with the widget, the plane can be manipulated by adjusting the plane
 normal or moving the origin point.

 To use this representation, you normally define a (plane) origin and (plane)
 normal. The PlaceWidget() method is also used to intially position the
 representation.

To create an instance of class vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkImplicitPlaneRepresentation
\endverbatim
