<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 The class serves as an abstract geometrical representation for the
 vtkTensorProbeWidget. It is left to the concrete implementation to render
 the tensors as it desires. For instance, 
 vtkEllipsoidTensorProbeRepresentation renders the tensors as ellipsoids.


To create an instance of class vtkTensorProbeRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkTensorProbeRepresentation
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkTensorProbeRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTensorProbeRepresentation class.

<LI>  <tt>int = obj.RenderOpaqueGeometry (vtkViewport )</tt> -  See vtkWidgetRepresentation for details.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProbePosition (double , double , double )</tt> -  Set the position of the Tensor probe.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProbePosition (double  a[3])</tt> -  Set the position of the Tensor probe.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>double = obj. GetProbePosition ()</tt> -  Set the position of the Tensor probe.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProbeCellId (vtkIdType )</tt> -  Set the position of the Tensor probe.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkIdType = obj.GetProbeCellId ()</tt> -  Set the position of the Tensor probe.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetTrajectory (vtkPolyData )</tt> -  Set the trajectory that we are trying to probe tensors on
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Initialize ()</tt> -  Set the probe position to a reasonable location on the trajectory.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.SelectProbe (int pos[2])</tt> -  This method is invoked by the widget during user interaction.
 Can we pick the tensor glyph at the current cursor pos
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.Move (double motionVector[2])</tt> -  INTERNAL - Do not use
 This method is invoked by the widget during user interaction.
 Move probe based on the position and the motion vector.
