<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class is used to represent a vtkHandleWidget. It represents a
 position in 3D world coordinates that is constrained to a specified plane.
 The default look is to draw a white point when this widget is not selected
 or active, a thin green circle when it is highlighted, and a thicker cyan
 circle when it is active (being positioned). Defaults can be adjusted - but
 take care to define cursor geometry that makes sense for this widget.
 The geometry will be aligned on the constraining plane, with the plane
 normal aligned with the X axis of the geometry (similar behavior to
 vtkGlyph3D). 

 TODO: still need to work on 
 1) translation when mouse is outside bounding planes
 2) size of the widget


To create an instance of class vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkConstrainedPointHandleRepresentation
\endverbatim

 or to be oblique. If it is oblique, then the plane is 
 defined in the ObliquePlane ivar.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetProjectionNormalMinValue ()</tt> -  Set the projection normal to lie along the x, y, or z axis,
 or to be oblique. If it is oblique, then the plane is

 bounding a point to an oblique reliced image that has hexagonal shape)
 than a simple extent.
