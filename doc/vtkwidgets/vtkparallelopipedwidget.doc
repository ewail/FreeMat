<p>
Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This widget was designed with the aim of visualizing / probing cuts on
 a skewed image data / structured grid. 

 .SECTION Interaction
 The widget allows you to create a parallelopiped (defined by 8 handles).
 The widget is initially placed by using the "PlaceWidget" method in the
 representation class. After the widget has been created, the following
 interactions may be used to manipulate it :
 1) Click on a handle and drag it around moves the handle in space, while
    keeping the same axis alignment of the parallelopiped
 2) Dragging a handle with the shift button pressed resizes the piped
    along an axis.
 3) Control-click on a handle creates a chair at that position. (A chair
    is a depression in the piped that allows you to visualize cuts in the
    volume). 
 4) Clicking on a chair and dragging it around moves the chair within the
    piped.
 5) Shift-click on the piped enables you to translate it.


To create an instance of class vtkParallelopipedWidget, simply
invoke its constructor as follows

\section Methods
The class vtkParallelopipedWidget has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkParallelopipedWidget class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParallelopipedWidget = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkParallelopipedWidget = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetEnabled (int )</tt> -  Override the superclass method. This is a composite widget, (it internally
 consists of handle widgets). We will override the superclass method, so
 that we can pass the enabled state to the internal widgets as well.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetRepresentation (vtkParallelopipedRepresentation r)</tt> -  Enable/disable the creation of a chair on this widget. If off,
 chairs cannot be created.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetEnableChairCreation (int )</tt> -  Enable/disable the creation of a chair on this widget. If off,
 chairs cannot be created.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.GetEnableChairCreation ()</tt> -  Enable/disable the creation of a chair on this widget. If off,
 chairs cannot be created.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.EnableChairCreationOn ()</tt> -  Enable/disable the creation of a chair on this widget. If off,
 chairs cannot be created.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.EnableChairCreationOff ()</tt> -  Enable/disable the creation of a chair on this widget. If off,
 chairs cannot be created.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.CreateDefaultRepresentation ()</tt> -  Create the default widget representation if one is not set. 
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetProcessEvents (int )</tt> -  Methods to change the whether the widget responds to interaction.
 Overridden to pass the state to component widgets.
