Section: \ref sec_vtkwidgets "Visualization Toolkit Widget Classes"
\section Usage
 This class is used to represent a vtkAffineWidget. This representation
 consists of three parts: a box, a circle, and a cross. The box is used for
 scaling and shearing, the circle for rotation, and the cross for
 translation. These parts are drawn in the overlay plane and maintain a
 constant size (width and height) specified in terms of normalized viewport
 coordinates. 

 The representation maintains an internal transformation matrix (see
 superclass' GetTransform() method). The transformations generated by this
 widget assume that the representation lies in the x-y plane. If this is
 not the case, the user is responsible for transforming this
 representation's matrix into the correct coordinate space (by judicious
 matrix multiplication). Note that the transformation matrix returned by
 GetTransform() is relative to the last PlaceWidget() invocation. (The
 PlaceWidget() sets the origin around which rotation and scaling occurs;
 the origin is the center point of the bounding box provided.)


To create an instance of class vtkAffineRepresentation2D, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
