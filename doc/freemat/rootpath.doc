\page freemat_rootpath ROOTPATH Set FreeMat Root Path

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
In order to function properly, FreeMat needs to know where to
find the <tt>toolbox</tt> directory as well as the <tt>help</tt> directory.
These directories are located on what is known as the <tt>root path</tt>.
Normally, FreeMat should know where these directories are located.
However under some circumstances (usually when FreeMat is installed
into a non-default location), it may be necessary to indicate
a different root path location, or to specify a particular one.
Note that on the Mac OS platform, FreeMat is installed as a bundle,
and will use the toolbox that is installed in the bundle regardless of
the setting for <tt>rootpath</tt>.
For Linux, FreeMat will typically use <tt>/usr/local/share/FreeMat-\<Version\>/</tt>
for the root path.  Installations from source code will generally work,
but binary installations (e.g., from an <tt>RPM</tt>) may need to have the
rootpath set.

The <tt>rootpath</tt> function has two forms.  The first form takes no arguments
and returns the current root path
\verbatim
   rootpath
\endverbatim
The second form will set a rootpath directly from the command line
\verbatim
   rootpath(path)
\endverbatim
where <tt>path</tt> is the full path to where the <tt>toolbox</tt> and <tt>help</tt> 
directories are located.  For example, <tt>rootpath('/usr/share/FreeMat-4.0')</tt>.
The third form enables the GUI form 
\verbatim
   rootpath gui
\endverbatim
which activates a dialog box to pick a directory that is the root directory
of the FreeMat installation (e.g., where <tt>help</tt> and <tt>toolbox</tt> are located.
Changes to <tt>rootpath</tt> are persistent (you do not need to run it every
time you start FreeMat).
