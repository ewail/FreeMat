\page freemat_profiler PROFILER Control Profiling

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>profile</tt> function allows you to control the FreeMat profiler.
It has two modes of operation.  The first is to enable-disable
the profiler.  To turn on profiling:
\verbatim
  profiler on
\endverbatim
to turn off profiling, use
\verbatim
  profiler off
\endverbatim
Note that regardless of the state of the profiler, only functions
and scripts are profiled.  Commands entered on the command line
are not profiled.  To see information that has accumulated in a
profile, you use the variant of the command:
\verbatim
  profiler list
\endverbatim
which lists current sorted profiling resuls. You can use this form to obtain 
profiler results as a cell array
\verbatim
  r=profiler('list')
\endverbatim
If you want to see current profile
status issue a <tt>profile</tt> command with no arguments.
\verbatim
   profiler
\endverbatim
