\page freemat_clocktotime CLOCKTOTIME Convert Clock Vector to Epoch Time

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
Given the output of the <tt>clock</tt> command, this function computes
the epoch time, i.e, the time in seconds since January 1,1970 
at 00:00:00 UTC.  This function is most useful for calculating elapsed
times using the clock, and should be accurate to less than a millisecond
(although the true accuracy depends on accuracy of the argument vector). 
The usage for <tt>clocktotime</tt> is
\verbatim
   y = clocktotime(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> must be in the form of the output of <tt>clock</tt>, that is
\verbatim
   x = [year month day hour minute seconds]
\endverbatim
\section Example
Here is an example of using <tt>clocktotime</tt> to time a delay of 1 second

\if FRAGMENT
frag_freemat_clocktotime_000.m
0
x = clock
sleep(1)
y = clock
clocktotime(y) - clocktotime(x)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_freemat_clocktotime_000.m.out
