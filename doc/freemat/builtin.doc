\page freemat_builtin BUILTIN Evaulate Builtin Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>builtin</tt> function evaluates a built in function
with the given name, bypassing any overloaded functions.
The syntax of <tt>builtin</tt> is
\verbatim
  [y1,y2,...,yn] = builtin(fname,x1,x2,...,xm)
\endverbatim
where <tt>fname</tt> is the name of the function to call.  Apart
from the fact that <tt>fname</tt> must be a string, and that <tt>builtin</tt>
always calls the non-overloaded method, it operates exactly like
<tt>feval</tt>.  Note that unlike MATLAB, <tt>builtin</tt> does not force
evaluation to an actual compiled function.  It simply subverts
the activation of overloaded method calls.
