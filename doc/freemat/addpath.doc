\section Usage
The <tt>addpath</tt> routine adds a set of directories to the current path.
The first form takes a single directory and adds it to the beginning
or top of the path:
\verbatim
  addpath('directory')
\endverbatim
The second form add several directories to the top of the path:
\verbatim
  addpath('dir1','dir2',...,'dirn')
\endverbatim
Finally, you can provide a flag to control where the directories get
added to the path
\verbatim
  addpath('dir1','dir2',...,'dirn','-flag')
\endverbatim
where if <tt>flag</tt> is either <tt>'-0'</tt> or <tt>'-begin'</tt>, the directories are
added to the top of the path, and if the <tt>flag</tt> is either <tt>'-1'</tt> or 
<tt>'-end'</tt> the directories are added to the bottom (or end) of the path.
