\page freemat_jitcontrol JITCONTROL Control the Just In Time Compiler

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>jitcontrol</tt> functionality in FreeMat allows you to control
the use of the Just In Time (JIT) compiler.  Starting in FreeMat
version 4, the JIT compiler is enabled by default on all platforms
where it is successfully built.  The JIT compiler should significantly
improve the performance of loop intensive, scalar code.  As development
progresses, more and more functionality will be enabled under the JIT.
In the mean time (if you use the GUI version of FreeMat) you can use
the JIT chat window to get information on why your code was JIT compiled
(or not).
