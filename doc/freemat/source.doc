\page freemat_source SOURCE Execute an Arbitrary File

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>source</tt> function executes the contents of the given
filename one line at a time (as if it had been typed at
the <tt>--></tt> prompt).  The <tt>source</tt> function syntax is
\verbatim
  source(filename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>filename</tt> is a <tt>string</tt> containing the name of
the file to process. 
\section Example
First, we write some commands to a file (note that it does
not end in the usual <tt>.m</tt> extension):

\if FILE
source_test
a = 32;
b = a;
printf('a is %d and b is %d\n',a,b);
\endif
\verbatim
     source_test
\endverbatim

\verbinclude source_test

Now we source the resulting file.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_freemat_source_000.m
0
clear a b
source source_test
\endif


\verbinclude frag_freemat_source_000.m.out
