\page freemat_evalin EVALIN Evaluate a String in Workspace

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>evalin</tt> function is similar to the <tt>eval</tt> function, with an additional
argument up front that indicates the workspace that the expressions are to 
be evaluated in.  The various syntaxes for <tt>evalin</tt> are:
\verbatim
   evalin(workspace,expression)
   x = evalin(workspace,expression)
   [x,y,z] = evalin(workspace,expression)
   evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
   x = evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
   [x,y,z] = evalin(workspace,try_clause,catch_clause)
\endverbatim
The argument <tt>workspace</tt> must be either 'caller' or 'base'.  If it is
'caller', then the expression is evaluated in the caller's work space.
That does not mean the caller of <tt>evalin</tt>, but the caller of the current
function or script.  On the other hand if the argument is 'base', then
the expression is evaluated in the base work space.   See <tt>eval</tt> for
details on the use of each variation.
