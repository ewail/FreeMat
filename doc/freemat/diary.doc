\page freemat_diary DIARY Create a Log File of Console

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>diary</tt> function controls the creation of a log file that duplicates
the text that would normally appear on the console.
The simplest syntax for the command is simply:
\verbatim
   diary
\endverbatim
which toggles the current state of the diary command.  You can also explicitly
set the state of the diary command via the syntax
\verbatim
   diary off
\endverbatim
or
\verbatim
   diary on
\endverbatim
To specify a filename for the log (other than the default of <tt>diary</tt>), you 
can use the form:
\verbatim
   diary filename
\endverbatim
or
\verbatim
   diary('filename')
\endverbatim
which activates the diary with an output filename of <tt>filename</tt>.  Note that the
<tt>diary</tt> command is thread specific, but that the output is appended to a given
file.  That means that if you call <tt>diary</tt> with the same filename on multiple 
threads, their outputs will be intermingled in the log file (just as on the console).
Because the <tt>diary</tt> state is tied to individual threads, you cannot retrieve the
current diary state using the <tt>get(0,'Diary')</tt> syntax from MATLAB.  Instead, you
must call the <tt>diary</tt> function with no inputs and one output:
\verbatim
   state = diary
\endverbatim
which returns a logical <tt>1</tt> if the output of the current thread is currently going to
a diary, and a logical <tt>0</tt> if not.
