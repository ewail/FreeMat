\page freemat_assignin ASSIGNIN Assign Variable in Workspace

<p>
Section: \ref sec_freemat "FreeMat Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>assignin</tt> function allows you to assign a value to a variable
in either the callers work space or the base work space.  The syntax
for <tt>assignin</tt> is
\verbatim
   assignin(workspace,variablename,value)
\endverbatim
The argument <tt>workspace</tt> must be either 'caller' or 'base'.  If it is
'caller' then the variable is assigned in the caller's work space.
That does not mean the caller of <tt>assignin</tt>, but the caller of the
current function or script.  On the other hand if the argument is 'base',
then the assignment is done in the base work space.  Note that the
variable is created if it does not already exist.
