\section Usage
A synonym for the <tt>float</tt> function, converts the argument to
a 32-bit floating point number.  The syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
   y = single(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion 
follows the general C rules.  Note that both <tt>NaN</tt> and <tt>Inf</tt> 
are both preserved under type conversion.
