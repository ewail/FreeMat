<p>
Section: \ref sec_typecast "Type Conversion Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>dcomplex</tt> function used to convert variables into 64-bit
complex data types in prior versions of FreeMat.  Starting with FreeMat 4,
the type rules are the same as Matlab, hence, there is no distinction
between a 64-bit complex type and and 64-bit real type.  Thus, the <tt>dcomplex</tt>
function is just a synonym for <tt>double</tt>.
