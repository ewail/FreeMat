\page typecast_uint32 UINT32 Convert to Unsigned 32-bit Integer

<p>
Section: \ref sec_typecast "Type Conversion Functions"
\section Usage
Converts the argument to an unsigned 32-bit Integer.  The syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
   y = uint32(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is an <tt>n</tt>-dimensional numerical array.  Conversion
follows saturation rules (e.g., if <tt>x</tt> is outside the normal
range for an unsigned 32-bit integer of <tt>[0,4294967295]</tt>, it is
truncated to that range. Note that both <tt>NaN</tt> and <tt>Inf</tt> both map to 0.
\section Example
The following piece of code demonstrates several uses of <tt>uint32</tt>.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_000.m
0
uint32(200)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_000.m.out 

In the next example, an integer outside the range of the type is passed in.  
The result is truncated to the maximum value of the data type.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_001.m
0
uint32(40e9)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_001.m.out 

In the next example, a negative integer is passed in.  The result is 
truncated to zero.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_002.m
0
uint32(-100)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_002.m.out 

In the next example, a positive double precision argument is passed in.  
The result is the unsigned integer that is closest to the argument.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_003.m
0
uint32(pi)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_003.m.out 

In the next example, a complex argument is passed in.  The result is the 
complex unsigned integer that is closest to the argument.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_004.m
0
uint32(5+2*i)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_004.m.out 

In the next example, a string argument is passed in.  The string argument 
is converted into an integer array corresponding to the ASCII values of each character.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_005.m
0
uint32('helo')
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_005.m.out 

In the last example, a cell-array is passed in.  For cell-arrays and 
structure arrays, the result is an error.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_typecast_uint32_006.m
1
uint32({4})
\endif


\verbinclude frag_typecast_uint32_006.m.out
