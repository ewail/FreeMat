<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>pause</tt> function can be used to pause execution of FreeMat
scripts.  There are several syntaxes for its use.  The first form
is
\verbatim
   pause
\endverbatim
This form of the <tt>pause</tt> function pauses FreeMat until you press
any key.  The second form of the <tt>pause</tt> function takes an argument
\verbatim
   pause(p)
\endverbatim
where <tt>p</tt> is the number of seconds to pause FreeMat for.  The pause
argument should be accurate to a millisecond on all supported platforms.
Alternately, you can control all <tt>pause</tt> statements using:
\verbatim
   pause on
\endverbatim
which enables pauses and
\verbatim
   pause off
\endverbatim
which disables all <tt>pause</tt> statements, both with and without arguments.
