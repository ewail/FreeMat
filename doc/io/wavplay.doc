Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Plays a linear PCM set of samples through the audio system.  This
function is only available if the <tt>portaudio</tt> library was available
when FreeMat was built.  The syntax for the command is one of:
\verbatim
   wavplay(y)
   wavplay(y,sampling_rate)
   wavplay(...,mode)
\endverbatim
where <tt>y</tt> is a matrix of audio samples.  If <tt>y</tt> has two columns, then
the audio playback is in stereo.  The <tt>y</tt> input can be of types 
<tt>float, double, int32, int16, int8, uint8</tt>.  For <tt>float</tt> and 
<tt>double</tt> types, the sample values in <tt>y</tt> must be between <tt>-1</tt> and
<tt>1</tt>.  The <tt>sampling_rate</tt> specifies the rate at which the data is 
recorded.  If not specified, the <tt>sampling_rate</tt> defaults to <tt>11025Hz</tt>.
Finally, you can specify a playback mode of <tt>'sync'</tt> which is synchronous
playback or a playback mode of <tt>'async'</tt> which is asynchronous playback.
For <tt>'sync'</tt> playback, the wavplay function returns when the playback is
complete.  For <tt>'async'</tt> playback, the function returns immediately (unless
a former playback is still issuing).
