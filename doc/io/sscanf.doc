\page io_sscanf SSCANF Formated String Input Function (C-Style)

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Reads values from a string.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  [a, count, errmsg, nextind] = sscanf(text,format,[size])
\endverbatim
Here <tt>format</tt> is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input, <tt>size</tt> specifies the amount of data to be read. Values that are parsed
from the <tt>text</tt> are stored in a. Note that sscanf is vectorized - the format string is reused as long as
there are entries in the <tt>text</tt> string. See <tt>printf</tt>
for a description of the format.
