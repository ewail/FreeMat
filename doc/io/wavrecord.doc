\section Usage
Records linear PCM sound from the audio system.  This function is
only available if the <tt>portaudio</tt> library was available when FreeMat
was built.  The syntax for this command is one of:
\verbatim
  y = wavrecord(samples,rate)
  y = wavrecord(...,channels)
  y = wavrecord(...,'datatype')
\endverbatim
where <tt>samples</tt> is the number of samples to record, and <tt>rate</tt> is the
sampling rate.  If not specified, the <tt>rate</tt> defaults to <tt>11025Hz</tt>.
If you want to record in stero, specify <tt>channels = 2</tt>.  Finally, you
can specify the type of the recorded data (defaults to <tt>FM_DOUBLE</tt>).
Valid choices are <tt>float, double, int32, int16, int8, uint8</tt>.
