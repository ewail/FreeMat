\page io_sprintf SPRINTF Formated String Output Function (C-Style)

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Prints values to a string.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = sprintf(format,a1,a2,...).
\endverbatim
Here <tt>format</tt> is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the output.  The values of the variables
<tt>a_i</tt> are substituted into the output as required.  It is
an error if there are not enough variables to satisfy the format
string.  Note that this <tt>sprintf</tt> command is not vectorized!  Each
variable must be a scalar.  The returned value <tt>y</tt> contains the
string that would normally have been printed. For
more details on the format string, see <tt>printf</tt>.  
\section Examples
Here is an example of a loop that generates a sequence of files based on
a template name, and stores them in a cell array.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_io_sprintf_000.m
0
l = {}; for i = 1:5; s = sprintf('file_%d.dat',i); l(i) = {s}; end;
l
\endif


\verbinclude frag_io_sprintf_000.m.out
