\page io_urlwrite URLWRITE Retrieve a URL into a File

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Given a URL and a timeout, attempts to retrieve the URL and write the
contents to a file.  The syntax is
\verbatim
   f = urlwrite(url,filename,timeout)
\endverbatim
The <tt>timeout</tt> is in milliseconds.  Note that the URL must be a complete
spec (i.e., including the name of the resource you wish to retrieve).  So
for example, you cannot use <tt>http://www.google.com</tt> as a URL, but must 
instead use <tt>http://www.google.com/index.html</tt>.
