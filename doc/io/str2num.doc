\page io_str2num STR2NUM Convert a String to a Number

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Converts a string to a number.  The general syntax for its use
is
\verbatim
  x = str2num(string)
\endverbatim
Here <tt>string</tt> is the data string, which contains the data to 
be converted into a number.  The output is in double precision,
and must be typecasted to the appropriate type based on what
you need.  Note that by definition, <tt>str2num</tt> is entirely 
equivalent to <tt>eval(['[' string ']'],[])</tt> with all of the 
associated problems where <tt>string</tt> contains text that causes
side effects.
