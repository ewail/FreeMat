\page io_xmlread XMLREAD Read an XML Document into FreeMat

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Given a filename, reads an XML document, parses it, and
returns the result as a FreeMat data structure.  The syntax for its
use is:
\verbatim
   p = xmlread(filename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>filename</tt> is a <tt>string</tt>.  The
resulting object <tt>p</tt> is a data structure containing the information
in the document.  Note that the returned object <tt>p</tt> is not the same
object as the one returned by MATLAB's <tt>xmlread</tt>, although the 
information content is the same.  The output is largely compatible with the 
output of the parseXML example in the <tt>xmlread</tt> documentation of the
MATLAB API.
