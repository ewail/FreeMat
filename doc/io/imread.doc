\page io_imread IMREAD Read Image File To Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Reads the image data from the given file into a matrix.  Note that
FreeMat's support for <tt>imread</tt> is not complete.  Only some of the
formats specified in the MATLAB API are implemented.  The syntax
for its use is
\verbatim
  [A,map,alpha] = imread(filename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>filename</tt> is the name of the file to read from.  The returned
arrays <tt>A</tt> contain the image data, <tt>map</tt> contains the colormap information
(for indexed images), and <tt>alpha</tt> contains the alphamap (transparency).
The returned values will depend on the type of the original image.  Generally
you can read images in the <tt>jpg,png,xpm,ppm</tt> and some other formats.
