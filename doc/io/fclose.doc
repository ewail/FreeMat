\page io_fclose FCLOSE File Close Function

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Closes a file handle, or all open file handles.  The general syntax
for its use is either
\verbatim
  fclose(handle)
\endverbatim
or
\verbatim
  fclose('all')
\endverbatim
In the first case a specific file is closed,  In the second, all open
files are closed.  Note that until a file is closed the file buffers
are not flushed.  Returns a '0' if the close was successful and a '-1' if
the close failed for some reason.
\section Example
A simple example of a file being opened with <tt>fopen</tt> and then closed with <tt>fclose</tt>.

\if FRAGMENT
frag_io_fclose_000.m
0
fp = fopen('test.dat','wb','ieee-le')
fclose(fp)
\endif


\verbinclude frag_io_fclose_000.m.out
