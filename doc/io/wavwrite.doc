\page io_wavwrite WAVWRITE Write a WAV Audio File

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
The <tt>wavwrite</tt> funtion writes an audio signal to a linear PCM WAV
file.  The simplest form for its use is
\verbatim
    wavwrite(y,filename)
\endverbatim
which writes the data stored in <tt>y</tt> to a WAV file with the name
<tt>filename</tt>.  By default, the output data is assumed to be sampled at a
rate of 8 KHz, and is output using 16 bit integer format.  Each column
of <tt>y</tt> is written as a separate channel.  The data are clipped to the
range <tt>[-1,1]</tt> prior to writing them out.  If you want the data to be
written with a different sampling frequency, you can use the following
form of the <tt>wavwrite</tt> command:
\verbatim
   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,filename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>SampleRate</tt> is in Hz.  Finally, you can specify the number of
bits to use in the output form of the file using the form
\verbatim
   wavwrite(y,SampleRate,NBits,filename)
\endverbatim
where <tt>NBits</tt> is the number of bits to use.  Legal values include
<tt>8,16,24,32</tt>.  For less than 32 bit output format, the data is
truncated to the range <tt>[-1,1]</tt>, and an integer output format is used
(type 1 PCM in WAV-speak).  For 32 bit output format, the data is
written in type 3 PCM as floating point data.
