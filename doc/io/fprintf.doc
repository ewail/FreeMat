\page io_fprintf FPRINTF Formated File Output Function (C-Style)

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Prints values to a file.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  fprintf(fp,format,a1,a2,...).
\endverbatim
or, 
\verbatim
  fprintf(format,a1,a2,...).
\endverbatim
Here <tt>format</tt> is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the output.  The values of the variables
<tt>ai</tt> are substituted into the output as required.  It is
an error if there are not enough variables to satisfy the format
string.  Note that this <tt>fprintf</tt> command is not vectorized!  Each
variable must be a scalar.  The value <tt>fp</tt> is the file handle.  If <tt>fp</tt> is omitted,
file handle <tt>1</tt> is assumed, and the behavior of <tt>fprintf</tt> is effectively equivalent to <tt>printf</tt>. For
more details on the format string, see <tt>printf</tt>.
\section Examples
A number of examples are present in the Examples section of the <tt>printf</tt> command.
