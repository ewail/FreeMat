\page io_rawwrite RAWWRITE Write N-dimensional Array From File

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
The syntax for <tt>rawwrite</tt> is
\verbatim
   function rawwrite(fname,x,byteorder)
\endverbatim
where <tt>fname</tt> is the name of the file to write to, and the
(numeric) array <tt>x</tt> is writen to the file in its native
type (e.g. if <tt>x</tt> is of type <tt>int16</tt>, then it will be written
to the file as 16-bit signed integers.  If <tt>byteorder</tt> is
left unspecified, the file is assumed to be
of the same byte-order as the machine <tt>FreeMat</tt> is running on.
If you wish to force a particular byte order, specify the <tt>byteorder</tt>
argument as
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>'le','ieee-le','little-endian','littleEndian','little'</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>'be','ieee-be','big-endian','bigEndian','big'</tt>
 </LI>
</UL>
