/*!
\page io_getline GETLINE Get a Line of Input from User

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Reads a line (as a string) from the user.  This function has
two syntaxes.  The first is 
\verbatim
  a = getline(prompt)
\endverbatim
where <tt>prompt</tt> is a prompt supplied to the user for the query.
The second syntax omits the <tt>prompt</tt> argument:
\verbatim
  a = getline
\endverbatim
Note that this function requires command line input, i.e., it 
will only operate correctly for programs or scripts written
to run inside the FreeMat GUI environment or from the X11 terminal.
If you build a stand-alone application and expect it to operate 
cross-platform, do not use this function (unless you include
the FreeMat console in the final application).
