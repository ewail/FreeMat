\page io_fscanf FSCANF Formatted File Input Function (C-Style)

<p>
Section: \ref sec_io "Input/Ouput Functions"
\section Usage
Reads values from a file.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  [a,count] = fscanf(handle,format,[size])
\endverbatim
Here <tt>format</tt> is the format string, which is a string that
controls the format of the input, <tt>size</tt> specifies the amount of data to be read. Values that are parsed
from the <tt>text</tt> are stored in a. Note that fscanf is vectorized - the format string is reused as long as
there are entries in the <tt>text</tt> string.
See <tt>printf</tt> for a description of the format.  Note that if
the file is at the end-of-file, the fscanf will return
