\page binary_bitor BITOR Bitwise Boolean Or Operation

<p>
Section: \ref sec_binary "Bitwise Operations"
\section Usage
Performs a bitwise binary or operation on the two arguments and
returns the result.  The syntax for its use is
\verbatim
   y = bitor(a,b)
\endverbatim
where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are multi-dimensional unsigned integer arrays.
The and operation is performed using 32 bit unsigned intermediates.  Note that if a
or b is a scalar, then each element of the other array is or'ed with
that scalar.  Otherwise the two arrays must match in size.
\section Example

\if FRAGMENT
frag_binary_bitor_000.m
0
bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16([3,17,128]))
bitand(uint16([1,16,255]),uint16(3))
\endif
