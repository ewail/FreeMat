Section: \ref sec_transforms "Transforms/Decompositions"
\section Usage
The <tt>hilbert</tt> function computes the hilbert transform of the argument
vector or matrix.  The FreeMat <tt>hilbert</tt> function is compatible with
the one from the MATLAB API.  This means that the output of the
<tt>hilbert</tt> function is the sum of the original function and an
imaginary signal containing the Hilbert transform of it.  There are
two syntaxes for the hilbert function.  The first is
\verbatim
  y = hilbert(x)
\endverbatim
where <tt>x</tt> is real vector or matrix.  If <tt>x</tt> is a matrix, then he
Hilbert transform is computed along the columns of <tt>x</tt>.  The
second syntax provides a dimension along which to take the
transform.
\verbatim
  y = hilbert(x,n)
\endverbatim
where <tt>n</tt> is the dimension along which to apply the transformation.
