\section Usage
Computes the QR factorization of a matrix.  The <tt>qr</tt> function has
multiple forms, with and without pivoting.  The non-pivot version
has two forms, a compact version and a full-blown decomposition
version.  The compact version of the decomposition of a matrix 
of size <tt>M x N</tt> is
\verbatim
  [q,r] = qr(a,0)
\endverbatim
where <tt>q</tt> is a matrix of size <tt>M x L</tt> and <tt>r</tt> is a matrix of
size <tt>L x N</tt> and <tt>L = min(N,M)</tt>, and <tt>q*r = a</tt>.  The QR decomposition is
such that the columns of <tt>Q</tt> are orthonormal, and <tt>R</tt> is upper
triangular.  The decomposition is computed using the LAPACK 
routine <tt>xgeqrf</tt>, where <tt>x</tt> is the precision of the matrix.  
FreeMat supports decompositions of <tt>single</tt> and <tt>double</tt> types.

The second form of the non-pivot decomposition omits the second <tt>0</tt>
argument:
\verbatim
  [q,r] = qr(a)
\endverbatim
This second form differs from the previous form only for matrices
with more rows than columns (<tt>M > N</tt>).  For these matrices, the
full decomposition is of a matrix <tt>Q</tt> of size <tt>M x M</tt> and 
a matrix <tt>R</tt> of size <tt>M x N</tt>.  The full decomposition is computed
using the same LAPACK routines as the compact decomposition, but
on an augmented matrix <tt>[a 0]</tt>, where enough columns are added to
form a square matrix.

Generally, the QR decomposition will not return a matrix <tt>R</tt> with
diagonal elements in any specific order.  The remaining two forms 
of the <tt>qr</tt> command utilize permutations of the columns of <tt>a</tt>
so that the diagonal elements of <tt>r</tt> are in decreasing magnitude.
To trigger this form of the decomposition, a third argument is
required, which records the permutation applied to the argument <tt>a</tt>.
The compact version is
\verbatim
  [q,r,e] = qr(a,0)
\endverbatim
where <tt>e</tt> is an integer vector that describes the permutation of
the columns of <tt>a</tt> necessary to reorder the diagonal elements of
<tt>r</tt>.  This result is computed using the LAPACK routines <tt>(s,d)geqp3</tt>.
In the non-compact version of the QR decomposition with pivoting,
\verbatim
  [q,r,e] = qr(a)
\endverbatim
the returned matrix <tt>e</tt> is a permutation matrix, such that 
<tt>q*r*e' = a</tt>.
