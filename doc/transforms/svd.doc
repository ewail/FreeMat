\page transforms_svd SVD Singular Value Decomposition of a Matrix

<p>
Section: \ref sec_transforms "Transforms/Decompositions"
\section Usage
Computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix.  The 
<tt>svd</tt> function has three forms.  The first returns only the singular
values of the matrix:
\verbatim
  s = svd(A)
\endverbatim
The second form returns both the singular values in a diagonal
matrix <tt>S</tt>, as well as the left and right eigenvectors.
\verbatim
  [U,S,V] = svd(A)
\endverbatim
The third form returns a more compact decomposition, with the
left and right singular vectors corresponding to zero singular
values being eliminated.  The syntax is
\verbatim
  [U,S,V] = svd(A,0)
\endverbatim
\section Function Internals
Recall that <tt>sigma_i</tt> is a singular value of an <tt>M x N</tt>
matrix <tt>A</tt> if there exists two vectors <tt>u_i, v_i</tt> where <tt>u_i</tt> is
of length <tt>M</tt>, and <tt>v_i</tt> is of length <tt>u_i</tt> and
\f[
  A v_i = \sigma_i u_i
\f]
and generally
\f[
  A = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sigma_i u_i*v_i',
\f]
where <tt>K</tt> is the rank of <tt>A</tt>.  In matrix form, the left singular
vectors <tt>u_i</tt> are stored in the matrix <tt>U</tt> as
\f[
  U = [u_1,\ldots,u_m], V = [v_1,\ldots,v_n]
\f]
The matrix <tt>S</tt> is then of size <tt>M x N</tt> with the singular
values along the diagonal.  The SVD is computed using the 
<tt>LAPACK</tt> class of functions <tt>GESVD</tt> (Note that this has
changed.  Previous versions of FreeMat used <tt>GESDD</tt>, which
yields a valid, but slightly different choice of the decomposition.
Starting in version 4, it was changed to <tt>GESVD</tt> to improve
compatibility.
\section Examples
Here is an example of a partial and complete singular value
decomposition.
