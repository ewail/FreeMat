Section: \ref sec_transforms "Transforms/Decompositions"
\section Usage
Computes the DFT of an N-dimensional numerical array along all
dimensions.  The general syntax for its use is
\verbatim
  y = fftn(x)
\endverbatim
which computes the same-size FFTs for each dimension of <tt>x</tt>.
Alternately, you can specify the size vector
\verbatim
  y = fftn(x,dims)
\endverbatim
where <tt>dims</tt> is a vector of sizes.  The array <tt>x</tt> is zero padded
or truncated as necessary in each dimension so that the output
is of size <tt>dims</tt>. The <tt>fftn</tt> function is implemented by a sequence
of calls to <tt>fft</tt>.
