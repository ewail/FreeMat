\section Usage
 vtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction is a concrete implementation of a
 ray cast function for unstructured grid data. This class was based on the
 paper "Simple, Fast, Robust Ray Casting of Irregular Grids" by Paul Bunyk,
 Arie Kaufmna, and Claudio Silva. This method is quite memory intensive 
 (with extra explicit copies of the data) and therefore should not be used
 for very large data. This method assumes that the input data is composed
 entirely of tetras - use vtkDataSetTriangleFilter before setting the input
 on the mapper.

 The basic idea of this method is as follows:

   1) Enumerate the triangles. At each triangle have space for some 
      information that will be used during rendering. This includes 
      which tetra the triangles belong to, the plane equation and the  
      Barycentric coefficients.

   2) Keep a reference to all four triangles for each tetra.

   3) At the beginning of each render, do the precomputation. This 
      includes creating an array of transformed points (in view 
      coordinates) and computing the view dependent info per triangle
      (plane equations and barycentric coords in view space)

   4) Find all front facing boundary triangles (a triangle is on the
      boundary if it belongs to only one tetra). For each triangle,
      find all pixels in the image that intersect the triangle, and
      add this to the sorted (by depth) intersection list at each 
      pixel.

   5) For each ray cast, traverse the intersection list. At each
      intersection, accumulate opacity and color contribution
      per tetra along the ray until you reach an exiting triangle
      (on the boundary).
