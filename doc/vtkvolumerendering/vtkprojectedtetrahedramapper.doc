\section Usage
 vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper is an implementation of the classic
 Projected Tetrahedra algorithm presented by Shirley and Tuchman in "A
 Polygonal Approximation to Direct Scalar Volume Rendering" in Computer
 Graphics, December 1990.

 .SECTION Bugs
 This mapper relies highly on the implementation of the OpenGL pipeline.
 A typical hardware driver has lots of options and some settings can
 cause this mapper to produce artifacts.


To create an instance of class vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper
\endverbatim
