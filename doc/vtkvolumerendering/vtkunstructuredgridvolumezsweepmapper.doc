Section: \ref sec_vtkvolumerendering "Visualization Toolkit Volume Rendering Classes"
\section Usage
 This is a volume mapper for unstructured grid implemented with the ZSweep
 algorithm. This is a software projective method.

To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
