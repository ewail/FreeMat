\section Usage

 vtkUnstructuredGridLinearRayIntegrator performs piecewise linear ray
 integration.  Considering that transfer functions in VTK are piecewise
 linear, this class should give the "correct" integration under most
 circumstances.  However, the computations performed are fairly hefty and
 should, for the most part, only be used as a benchmark for other, faster
 methods.


To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridLinearRayIntegrator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridLinearRayIntegrator
\endverbatim
