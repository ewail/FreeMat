\section Usage
  vtkFiniteDifferenceGradientEstimator is a concrete subclass of 
  vtkEncodedGradientEstimator that uses a central differences technique to
  estimate the gradient. The gradient at some sample location (x,y,z)
  would be estimated by:
      
       nx = (f(x-dx,y,z) - f(x+dx,y,z)) / 2*dx;
       ny = (f(x,y-dy,z) - f(x,y+dy,z)) / 2*dy;
       nz = (f(x,y,z-dz) - f(x,y,z+dz)) / 2*dz;

  This value is normalized to determine a unit direction vector and a
  magnitude. The normal is computed in voxel space, and 
  dx = dy = dz = SampleSpacingInVoxels. A scaling factor is applied to
  convert this normal from voxel space to world coordinates.


To create an instance of class vtkFiniteDifferenceGradientEstimator, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkFiniteDifferenceGradientEstimator
\endverbatim
