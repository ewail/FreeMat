\section Usage

 vtkUnstructuredGridPartialPreIntegration performs piecewise linear ray
 integration.  This will give the same results as
 vtkUnstructuredGridLinearRayIntegration (with potentially a error due to
 table lookup quantization), but should be notably faster.  The algorithm
 used is given by Moreland and Angel, "A Fast High Accuracy Volume
 Renderer for Unstructured Data."

 This class is thread safe only after the first instance is created.


To create an instance of class vtkUnstructuredGridPartialPreIntegration, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkUnstructuredGridPartialPreIntegration
\endverbatim
