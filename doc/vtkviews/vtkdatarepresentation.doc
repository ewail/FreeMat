\section Usage
 vtkDataRepresentation the superclass for representations of data objects.
 This class itself may be instantiated and used as a representation
 that simply holds a connection to a pipeline.

 If there are multiple representations present in a view, you should use
 a subclass of vtkDataRepresentation.  The representation is
 responsible for taking the input pipeline connection and converting it
 to an object usable by a view.  In the most common case, the representation
 will contain the pipeline necessary to convert a data object into an actor
 or set of actors.

 The representation has a concept of a selection.  If the user performs a
 selection operation on the view, the view forwards this on to its
 representations.  The representation is responsible for displaying that
 selection in an appropriate way.

 Representation selections may also be linked.  The representation shares
 the selection by converting it into a view-independent format, then
 setting the selection on its vtkAnnotationLink.  Other representations
 sharing the same selection link instance will get the same selection
 from the selection link when the view is updated.  The application is
 responsible for linking representations as appropriate by setting the
 same vtkAnnotationLink on each linked representation.

To create an instance of class vtkDataRepresentation, simply
invoke its constructor as follows
\verbatim
  obj = vtkDataRepresentation
\endverbatim
\section Methods
The class vtkDataRepresentation has several methods that can be used.
  They are listed below.
Note that the documentation is translated automatically from the VTK sources,
and may not be completely intelligible.  When in doubt, consult the VTK website.
In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkDataRepresentation class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkDataRepresentation = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>

<LI>  <tt>vtkDataRepresentation = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAlgorithmOutput = obj.GetInputConnection (int port, int index)</tt> -  The annotation link for this representation.
 To link annotations, set the same vtkAnnotationLink object in
 multiple representations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAnnotationLink = obj.GetAnnotationLink ()</tt> -  The annotation link for this representation.
 To link annotations, set the same vtkAnnotationLink object in
 multiple representations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetAnnotationLink (vtkAnnotationLink link)</tt> -  The annotation link for this representation.
 To link annotations, set the same vtkAnnotationLink object in
 multiple representations.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.ApplyViewTheme (vtkViewTheme )</tt> -  The view calls this method when a selection occurs.
 The representation takes this selection and converts it into
 a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection,
 then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection.
 Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead
 override ConvertSelection.
 The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be
 added to the previous selection on this representation.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Select (vtkView view, vtkSelection selection)</tt> -  The view calls this method when a selection occurs.
 The representation takes this selection and converts it into
 a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection,
 then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection.
 Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead
 override ConvertSelection.
 The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be
 added to the previous selection on this representation.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.Select (vtkView view, vtkSelection selection, bool extend)</tt> -  The view calls this method when a selection occurs.
 The representation takes this selection and converts it into
 a selection on its data by calling ConvertSelection,
 then calls UpdateSelection with the converted selection.
 Subclasses should not overrride this method, but should instead
 override ConvertSelection.
 The optional third argument specifies whether the selection should be
 added to the previous selection on this representation.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetSelectable (bool )</tt> -  Whether this representation is able to handle a selection.
 Default is true.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>bool = obj.GetSelectable ()</tt> -  Whether this representation is able to handle a selection.
 Default is true.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SelectableOn ()</tt> -  Whether this representation is able to handle a selection.
 Default is true.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SelectableOff ()</tt> -  Whether this representation is able to handle a selection.
 Default is true.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UpdateSelection (vtkSelection selection)</tt> -  Updates the selection in the selection link and fires a selection
 change event. Subclasses should not overrride this method,
 but should instead override ConvertSelection.
 The optional second argument specifies whether the selection should be
 added to the previous selection on this representation.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.UpdateSelection (vtkSelection selection, bool extend)</tt> -  Updates the selection in the selection link and fires a selection
 change event. Subclasses should not overrride this method,
 but should instead override ConvertSelection.
 The optional second argument specifies whether the selection should be
 added to the previous selection on this representation.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAlgorithmOutput = obj.GetInternalAnnotationOutputPort ()</tt> -  The output port that contains the annotations whose selections are
 localized for a particular input data object.
 This should be used when connecting the internal pipelines.

 This should be used when connecting the internal pipelines.
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkAlgorithmOutput = obj.GetInternalSelectionOutputPort (int port)</tt> -  The output port that contains the selection associated with the
 current annotation (normally the interactive selection).
