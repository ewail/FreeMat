\section Usage
 vtkGraphLayoutView performs graph layout and displays a vtkGraph.
 You may color and label the vertices and edges using fields in the graph.
 If coordinates are already assigned to the graph vertices in your graph,
 set the layout strategy to PassThrough in this view. The default layout
 is Fast2D which is fast but not that good, for better layout set the
 layout to Simple2D or ForceDirected. There are also tree and circle
 layout strategies. :)
