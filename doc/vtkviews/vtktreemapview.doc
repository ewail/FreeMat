In the methods listed below, <tt>obj</tt> is an instance of the vtkTreeMapView class.
<UL>
<LI>  <tt>string = obj.GetClassName ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>int = obj.IsA (string name)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTreeMapView = obj.NewInstance ()</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>vtkTreeMapView = obj.SafeDownCast (vtkObject o)</tt>
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLayoutStrategy (vtkAreaLayoutStrategy s)</tt> -  Sets the treemap layout strategy
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLayoutStrategy (string name)</tt> -  Sets the treemap layout strategy
 </LI>
<LI>  <tt>obj.SetLayoutStrategyToBox ()</tt> -  Sets the treemap layout strategy
